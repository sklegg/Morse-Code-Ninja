He has more to give.
There is the little boy.
What would you have me do?
See, they are here.
But what did you want?
Put it on.
Here she is.
Play with them.
After three, he said.
Where is he now?
And in she went.
How do you take it?
How can you think of such a thing?
What is that in your hand?
He said too much.
Here is my hand.
He went on his way.
Then will come our time.
Where did you place it?
Where could he be?
She was right.
What a good thing it would be.
And where is it?
Go and try.
Well then, tell him so.
Good, he said.
Much good that would be.
That is all one can say about her.
What is his name?
Where are you off to?
Good day to you.
What do you think of him?
What do you think of this?
Very well then.
How does he use it?
He was so kind.
There was work to do.
How old was she?
Why are they here?
Have you been here long?
You must come now.
Tell me his name.
He said that that would help.
Too much for me now.
When will her mother come?
What does it all mean?
Give me your hand.
Come with me, then.
And what did she say?
Where do they get that?
Then they will follow you?
Take this and this.
Did you tell him?
The world is before you.
What more could a man ask for?
do you come from the end of the world?
But where is it?
Think of him.
Been back long?
Can you help me find my way?
Say no more.
How can you tell?
Who is that man?
You are a good boy.
Is that all you want?
Large or small?
Which house is it?
Here is the way we put in the time.
It was high time.
No, tell me.
We are who we say we are.
There will just be time.
And that was the end of it.
He went to him.
And where was the place?
Such as what?
Think what you will.
there are only two.
Why, what is it, then?
Good day, one and all.
But he is right.
Why is he here?
How did that help you?
It must be where you put it.
That is the end of her.
This for me?
Try it on.
All in good time.
Think it over.
What is your name?
Now tell me.
What did you say your name was?
At your house?
Why do you want to know?
Who will tell her?
What do you want?
Why is that?
Were you here before me?
And what will they do with us?
Time to get out.
And do you know why?
Is there no one who can help me?
Very well, he said.
How long have you been here?
He was there too.
Where is she?
And off we go.
And have you been here long?
Well, what do you think?
You think so, too?
They want more.
Ask him to show up?
What do they want?
Take some, she said.
She came up to them.
Look at it other way round.
If you want to know, go and find out.
That is right, said the old man.
That is just my point.
Where have they been?
What do you mean?
Follow me, said the man.
What does she want?
What do they say was the cause?
Do you know me?
How much are they?
Give me more than that
That is right.
But where are we to go?
Call me what you will, he said.
What does she think about me?
Ask her, he said.
See, here it is.
And where is he now?
Give it me.
She was the cause of it all.
Do it for me.
where did she come from?
All right, then.
Is it all right?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
What on earth does this mean?
Show us where you live, said the man.
How old are you?
Do you want me to do it?
How can you find out?
And what about your mother?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
It was now his turn to look about him.
And what do you think?
She had to tell him.
Now where did they come from?
And how did you find out?
Is it any good?
Who are these men?
What is in your hand?
She has a house?
Where are we?
Is that right?
Do you think so?
What do you want me to do?
It would be very kind of you.
You can help me here.
Well, what do you think about it?
What do you think of that?
It is very kind of you.
They had all been very good to us.
Hand it in.
Tell us all about it.
It is great.
And what is her name?
Where in the world did you come from?
Would you now like to look round my place?
And how in the world did you find them?
Some day you may ask me about it.
Will you try?
And where is this man?
But why do you ask?
What on earth do you mean?
This is my point.
Well, did he?
Are you back again?
That was a house to look at.
Why are you here?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Will you come with me?
And a very good thing, too.
What could she mean by it?
Too much of this.
He is at my house.
It will take a little time.
Where did he come from?
Then why are you here?
take them all.
How does she use you?
To what end?
Is this the man?
Why do you want water?
Where to, now?
He will ask for it.
What was his name?
You must tell me.
What do you mean by that?
Get to work.
What does all this mean?
You are all very kind to me.
Give me my work.
Get out and play.
Now it was time to act.
But where is he?
this one, too?
Too much in the way.
Well, how are you?
What have you been after?
They are here.
How did you get me out?
But what does it mean?
You can say what it is.
In what part of the house?
What will you say?
You are right.
We will say no more about it, then.
Then what kind is it?
Tell us your name.
Show me the way.
Where does he live?
You are most kind.
How much do you want?
You see it every day.
It is the same thing.
Come with me.
She went on.
Are you here for good?
Well, read it.
Where is he?
But this is the point.
Is it as good now?
What was it you said to me?
Why, what do you mean?
And who is the man?
There was no one near.
Move on, then.
One, two, three.
How on earth do you know?
What did he tell you?
Now, go home.
Come with me to the little house.
This is the first act.
Tell me about it.
Where are you?
And what are they made of?
What does he mean?
When will it take place?
Show me the way he went.
And why is that?
She has been with him many long years.
You must take me with you.
There she is again.
Well, tell me.
And they went home.
Why did he come?
Where are you from?
It is very high.
But he does so need a mother.
He was here.
Read that, he said.
Are they like each other?
There is no one here to see.
Tell me all about it.
Well then, what do you want?
Very well, show him to me.
We are here.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Look at me.
Is it you or me?
Is he big?
Give me a light.
That was a good time.
How can you say that?
Well, how did it go?
Where have you been?
Just look through it.
Do you think she was?
Just look at her.
Now we see the light.
What you have just said is good, very good.
Just like me.
Do you think so now?
Is it large?
And it did me good.
He will live.
Get out of the way.
Is she well?
When will he come back?
Tell me who made the world.
But why do you ask me?
But it is just so with the world.
Say no more about it.
Give it to me, then.
What do you play?
There, that does me good.
Well, all right.
Now come here.
Here it is.
Well, and is that all?
That would be very good.
Is there some for me?
Say what you want.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Give him air.
Now, what do you want with me?
There is more to tell.
What did he say?
What do you think of her?
Well, go on.
Can you take me?
Turn this way.
He was at work again.
Will you take me to her?
Here it is, he said.
For how much?
Three, he said.
But what about me?
You know, you see right through people.
But who was your mother?
Only two there now.
No, mother.
Where are they off to now?
This is the man.
How did you get here?
What did you say that for?
It is all the same.
Are you at it again?
What could set you off in the first place?
Well, and what do you think?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Well, here he is.
You were near him.
Show it to me.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
There is no place like home.
You think so?
Is he a good man?
What will each of you give?
Where do you live?
The first act was over.
I would like to see her again in that.
You will get on in the world.
And where is she, then?
Think no more about that.
Come and help me.
Where are we to turn for help?
What do you want to ask these people?
Why are you like this?
We must come back.
Now, you know me.
Can you point it out to me?
But you must.
That was very good.
In what year?
And what was his name?
Read that, she said.
And how old were you at that time?
What does one live for?
And what did he say?
How could she say such a thing.
For some man.
