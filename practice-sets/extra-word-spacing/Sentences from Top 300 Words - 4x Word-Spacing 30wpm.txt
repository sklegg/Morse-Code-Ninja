But it was very late.
Are you sure?
Do you have the letter?
It was like new life to him.
They came over last night.
Dont you see that?
In the country?
Life is all right.
Do you want to cross?
Now or never.
Let me go to the door.
Well, run back to her.
It was the last day of the year.
Who was the letter from?
Let us go back.
You should take me there one day.
No, why should he?
Dont say that to me.
Who could have thought it?
He might still be up.
Is my father here?
Keep to the right.
Let me see him.
Come here, my friend.
Stop, let me show you the way.
There was no letter for me.
What did you hear?
How many are left?
Let me see her.
Right here it began.
It must be in her own house.
You are sure of it?
And who is this friend?
Let me hear what it is.
You found him?
Where could you keep it?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
You must study.
Have you been at sea?
There, do you hear?
Stop, said he.
Stop and think.
We are very far from that.
Keep to the left.
It is well thought of.
At last we have a man.
what river is it?
Is there any answer?
He may come close.
How many children?
We were together.
Watch him, he said.
He is always at it.
And why should they?
And what did you learn from him?
That is the idea.
Music is a good thing.
Here is the book.
Any book will tell you that.
Here he is at last.
We should ask him.
We found it.
Who can answer for that?
She saw it.
A second man got up and went out.
But watch over him.
He is my friend.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Which end is his head?
He is my father.
Write an answer.
What did he say in the letter?
He has been been found.
It is a long story.
No, dont.
And this food?
You saw him?
We got to let that go.
What country does he come from?
Just set still and take it like a man.
And she left the room.
How would they stop it?
And then they began to fish.
This is my country.
But why dont you want to take it?
Our own people must come first.
Why dont you want to go?
Open the door.
It is open?
What was it that you thought?
Dont you want any?
And what did you do with that letter?
She might be at his house.
Watch over him.
What was left of him?
But she saw no one?
What do you hear?
But then you would be close to the sea?
One night more and he would be on his way.
What did he answer?
It will be too late.
You will answer for it.
We should look at this.
There was no answer.
Then, good night.
Dont move, he said.
You must eat now.
Now you must eat.
Just cut it out.
Have you got that?
The sun had set long since.
Why is he cross with me?
These were the first people we saw.
Say good night.
The children will live just the same.
Come let us see them.
Cut him down.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Are we late?
It is always so.
First turn to the left.
Can you hear me?
They never come back.
Let me hear your story.
Why, dont you hear it?
Still, you never know.
Think of my father.
Are you my friend?
She got up.
But it is the same with any life.
He could run no more.
Do you hear that?
Come at once.
Who found them out?
Are you sure of it?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
She is my friend.
Have you got it?
Give me the letter.
Did you see his eye?
Let her go.
Let me say one thing.
Dont tell me.
It was very hard.
What is your real name?
Does he never go out?
But you must never tell.
He saw his men draw back.
Let me look.
How did it begin?
What do you think of the music?
What was the name of the man who took it?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
You have a car?
Let me go back.
Who did you learn that from?
When did you begin?
Was you in my room?
Call the next one.
But now it is too late.
That night we were just in time.
Have you found it?
We must go at once.
At four, she said.
Go to your father.
Where is this city?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
She never came back.
Let him follow me.
The other night she left.
Who let you in?
To the left.
Let me have a word with you.
Well, read the letter again.
Look at his face.
Let me see him at once.
Why dont you play?
She came in just now by the back door.
And then we may begin.
No, that can never be.
There are only four of us.
This took him some time.
And he left the room.
For once you are right.
Let me get to work.
Few had found it.
They dont care.
So take care of me.
But are you sure of that?
Sure of what?
Let us go in.
Let them have it.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
She came over last night.
A call for help, you thought?
Do you hear me?
How much have you got?
This is real.
What is life to you?
Off with her head.
Always the same, year after year.
Then let me have a word with you.
You got me?
Here is the letter.
Will you never learn?
See him grow up.
Let us start, then.
Take care.
We dont see it like that.
But what did you hear?
Both of us.
It is from your father.
You might want it.
Tell her to begin.
Why should they?
Let him grow up with you.
Good for the country.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Off with his head.
Let him answer us.
Is it in the city?
Come over in the sun.
You must never tell.
What a start that was.
And there are four of you?
Well, what next?
Why should this be so?
Here is the paper.
Is that far?
They dont know their own country.
Who said four?
They are hard at it.
Do we stop here?
No, stop.
Let us cross over.
But then it will be too late.
Now let me have it.
It might help.
You took it.
How could you begin?
They always know.
No, said her father.
Is it far?
It was then time to start.
That was the first night.
It is music.
Can you stand?
Good night again.
Do you know how he made his mark?
We got one and they got one.
So they got out and went in.
We never thought of that.
Tell us a story.
But it is all all too late now.
How could you let him go so far?
Let me see it.
Dont you like it?
Point it at his horse.
No, said the Tree.
It was the first thing he thought of.
We must begin again.
It would seem so.
You must walk.
Are we too late?
There to the left.
We might learn a thing or two.
At this time of my life, no.
But take care.
She must have a hard time with him.
Only, dont look back.
Where have you been this long while?
Just a few.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Who took him out of it?
What do you think when you hear music?
Which story was it?
Have you never been there?
We may be too late.
Where is the river?
Never see him again.
it took all that time to come over the water.
They may tell us to open it.
So it always was.
Do you have a car?
So, once more, good night.
He came at once.
You are sure of that?
One never has too much.
Tell me more.
He said at last.
By and by he got it.
No, never.
Let me out.
Good night, friend.
There were few near me.
But you got to play music for them.
Why do you stop here?
Let me know at once when you will start.
Why, it was one of his own men.
It was his own room.
There is only food for one.
Come, let us be men.
One was on a white horse.
Who should it be?
He had only one night more to live.
And now, good night.
What should he say?
Always the same with you people.
One of us will be here all night.
But they may still come here.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
He is at sea.
We are together.
Dont you think so?
Come eat with me.
And your children?
You are right, father.
Ask one of those men.
We got under way at last.
Where has she run off to?
Is he a real father?
He had two left feet.
But let us walk.
Let me be and let me live.
And now let us go home.
Just cut it out, will you?
Let me in.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Do you often come back?
Keep watch all night.
She is still here?
He then said, It is time to start.
This is what began it all.
Do you know where he is?
But hard to tell.
Take care of him.
Do you know what he did last night?
What a night it has been.
He has children of his own.
Why, is it late?
Let me get on with my work.
It is so very kind of you both.
What would you have me do with my life?
Cut your hand open?
So he began to help.
They never did it again.
She saw no one?
Do you want some more to eat?
Here we see the boy at school.
My father is right.
But it would be in the paper.
It was white.
They are always the same.
