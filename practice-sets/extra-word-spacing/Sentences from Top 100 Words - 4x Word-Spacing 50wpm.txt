Can you do that?
There you are.
Who are you?
Who was he?
What is it like?
And is that all?
No one will come, she said.
What is that?
And do you like her?
Then there is more to do.
How was that?
What did he do to you?
Would you like some?
Look over it.
Did you see it?
What is there to see?
Look at him.
Do you like him?
Then make it up.
There you are, he said.
And do you like him?
What was it about?
That is a long time.
How do you do?
What would she have said?
But what are you up to?
What will you do, then?
You can have some.
May we come in?
What do you make of that?
You have them?
and so on, and so on.
Is that all?
What can this be?
And how did you find out?
Do you know him?
At what number?
Can one see from there?
But it has been so long.
That was it.
How are you?
Do you know what it is?
Who is she?
what has she to do with it?
And could she see him?
What could it be?
But what is it?
Or so they said.
But when will that be?
What is all this?
You may go.
Will that do?
She has it.
What are we to do?
So be it.
who can it be?
How is he now?
So it is.
But he had to have it.
Then what is it?
When was it?
When is it?
Then how many are there?
Which is it?
Did you know them?
What DO you know of him?
And what do you make of it?
Do you see him?
What is it for?
It was from you.
Tqhen you may go.
But how about you?
Are you there?
What are you up to?
but what if it is?
You can do it.
So that was the way.
You know more than we do.
Do you know what you look like?
But how is that?
How did he do it?
Did you know him?
There he is, do you see him?
Is that it?
Is he there?
Look at it this way.
But what will you do?
Who and what are you?
What did they do?
Do as you will.
Is it over?
We have no water.
He said no.
No was there one?
Did you see her?
How can it be?
How is he?
So it was.
That is what she did.
Do as you like.
But so it is.
Is that her?
Now is your time.
That was all she said.
Do you know?
Who will go first?
How would you like to have it?
We have him.
The time will come.
But it was of no use.
The time had come.
Then who are you?
That will do, he said.
You can go.
Now what are we to do with you?
but there was more to it than this.
When was that?
What was he like?
What do you see?
Is it like him?
Out of the way.
Had to look the other way.
are you there?
And when will you call?
You know how it is with her.
What time is it?
Call him in.
What can we do, then?
How did you know about it?
And what did you see?
Has it come to this?
Can it be?
Now there is no more to be said.
What is he like?
And all for what?
But WHAT DID you see?
What is it all about?
And who was that?
And who is this?
That will do, said he.
How long has he been there?
What do they call you?
What other way is there to look at it?
Then, how do you know?
Come this way.
How is she?
How can you know?
Do you know her?
Look at them.
How did she do it?
There he is, she said.
But will he see it?
what is it?
And what do you call her?
There is but one thing to do.
Do they know him?
You have it.
There were two of them.
Who was that?
And who are you?
Then what are you up to now?
Is she like him?
So there it was.
but we can go and see.
Did you know her?
There he is, you see.
How did you come by it?
But what have they been up to?
What was it?
And what is that?
And what was it for?
What is it about?
Look at it.
At what time?
Would you do what he did?
And has it come to this?
One or two?
Go on, he said.
who, then, are you?
Will you come and see her?
What have you come for?
Do you see it?
What do you make of it?
But who was she?
But he had no time.
They said no more.
And what did you do then?
What did you do then?
Is it time?
There they are.
Now you know.
There he is, you see.
Now what are we to do with you?
That will do, said he.
You know how it is with her.
What was it about?
Had to look the other way.
How do you do?
And do you like her?
But who was she?
And when will you call?
and so on, and so on.
Do you know her?
What do you make of that?
who can it be?
And all for what?
But what are you up to?
But will he see it?
What could it be?
How are you?
Will that do?
There he is, she said.
And what did you see?
The time will come.
Did you know her?
That was it.
Then what are you up to now?
Now is your time.
Look at it.
What was it?
What have you come for?
who, then, are you?
What is it for?
Has it come to this?
But it has been so long.
You can do it.
But how about you?
but what if it is?
What other way is there to look at it?
They said no more.
Then what is it?
You have it.
When was that?
Look at it this way.
What can this be?
Do you like him?
But what is it?
And is that all?
What did you do then?
And who is this?
How did you know about it?
And how did you find out?
And what do you make of it?

How did she do it?
You know more than we do.
Then make it up.
We have him.
What do they call you?
But he had no time.
What is that?
Call him in.
So it was.
But what will you do?
It was from you.
So that was the way.
You may go.
How can it be?
but there was more to it than this.
Who and what are you?
what has she to do with it?
There he is, do you see him?
Can one see from there?
What do you see?
No was there one?
He said no.
Is that it?
What do you make of it?
Did you know him?
Is it like him?
What are we to do?
Do you know what it is?
We have no water.
