Oh, you are there.
He began to laugh.
Try to sleep.
Yes, she could sing that.
She got her hand free.
At his side was a large green box.
What has he done?
My mind is made up.
But she is nothing to me now.
Of course it is.
Now we must wait.
What have they done?
Nothing had come of it.
She heard and saw nothing.
My mind was soon made up.
Did it all rest on me?
And sit in the dark?
All was dark.
How can a little dog laugh?
He gave me this paper.
It was full of people.
It was brought to me.
Then lead the way.
She gave me her hand.
What a game.
What is done is done.
They know nothing about it.
Oh, nothing.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
That is a fact.
The water ran dry.
The old man gave no answer.
Oh, do you know?
But they could see nothing.
It was a very dark night.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
How was that possible?
Leave the rest to me.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
She was still game.
Yes, that is true.
And yet you said he had money.
It was a dark night.
Nothing new under the sun.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Her voice was low.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
The night was very dark.
But what then must be done?
But let us see your plan.
She could think of nothing more to say.
The island was a mile long.
His will be done.
He left long ago.
Oh, of course.
But never mind that.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Never mind how he came here.
Oh, very well, he said.
Why, of course.
But wait a minute.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Oh, to be sure.
Yes, we know that.
It was cold and dark.
You know nothing about it.
Oh, come now.
Bring this with you.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Go in there and drive them out.
Go back to bed.
It is very clear.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
You can hear that, miss?
I hear his voice in the house.
He is in the box.
Go and rest.
You must stay.
It is possible.
How long ago?
Fine, very fine.
You love a certain person.
It was a warm night.
It was right in front of us.
Yes, of course.
He will sleep an hour.
It is done.
What age is he?
Yes and no.
Then it is certain?
is it come yet?
It is time for bed.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Well, what about my plan?
Stay where you are.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Better sit still.
What kind of voice is it?
Which box do you mean?
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Come, and we can rest together.
Behind every book is a man.
Nothing could be more simple.
Oh, this is too much.
Behind my bed.
It is certain.
We must be quick.
It was so very long ago.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Well, but where can he fly to?
Why should my father fly?
Clear the way.
Wait for me here, all of you.
You can sleep here.
You must have a rest.
Sit down, said the old man.
He brought it with him for us to see.
What can be done?
Yes, she was back.
This is a test.
Are you strong?
Again came the voice.
He must be in the same boat as us.
And you can do nothing until then?
Here is our plan.
Well, sit down by me.
Where can you wait for me?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Well, sit down.
Is that a fact?
This made him wonder more and more.
No, nothing at all.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
You knew it, and said nothing?
and so he decide he go back home.
We brought them in.
How is that done?
There is a lot of people.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Yes, what is it?
Oh, how can you sleep?
Oh let me in.
Let us sit down.
Fly, my friend.
We are more strong together.
Oh, go on.
In that town there is a street.
You brought no one with you?
Nothing could have been better.
Well then, be quick.
And then the game began all over again.
There is no one in that room behind you.
He ran up to them.
What have they done with my work?
Yes, he did.
His plan is very simple.
Never mind me.
And what have you done to me?
Never mind that.
Then all was dark again.
Yes, it is true.
Quick, friend, quick.
Wait and see.
All of this was possible.
Get to bed.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Oh, do the best you can.
Oh, take me with you.
They would cry.
How was it done?
Did she stay long?
They call him a fine boy.
He had made up his mind.
Yes, but what did she say?
It is a real bed.
You know you must say yes.
That would be a fine thing.
Hold on a minute.
Oh, but you were there?
But how long ago?
Are they on foot?
In her name, then, let it be done.
Oh, dont ask me.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
There is no possible way.
Laugh, if you will.
What more is to be done?
Well, there he stood.
If only they would be quick.
No, nothing of the kind.
There was more to be done.
Nothing at all.
Yes, once.
Bring it here.
Is it certain?
Do you see that island?
What has brought you here?
You better stay here all night.
Lead me to him.
Yes, go and find out.
Well, miss?
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Oh, that.
They need a rest.
Decide if you are going back home.
What have you done?
He never said nothing.
Wonder is it like that.
Very well, wait a minute.
The night was dark.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Well, what does that lead up to?
He saw nothing.
Answer me that, miss.
See what you have done.
But what must be done?
Well, of course.
Of course it might.
In a minute.
What brought you here?
He was here a minute ago.
Oh, he is so kind.
We are free to act and think.
You will fall.
Yes, very well.
Who brought you up?
Yes, go on.
Oh, man.
Yes, there it is.
Nothing she can eat?
Your voice is that of a young man.
Oh, if men only knew.
But it must be done soon.
Clear my name.
It was hot.
Wait a minute.
How long would you keep me in town?
Clear the table.
You are in my power.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
There, by the wheel.
He must wait.
It is no use, said a voice.
He has a good voice still.
He stood up.
You are free to do so.
Free to do what?
Yes, he said.
And here is the note.
Look at that dark water.
Come quick.
Of course they will.
Can it be possible?
But that is nothing to us.
Yes, and no.
Is it possible?
Of course she will.
It stood behind the door.
She began to cry.
He knew nothing.
The snow is deep.
Nothing is more simple.
He is among us.
Is he in bed?
It was a record run.
Let me see your plan.
What is power?
Wonder if he has a name.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Bring them here.
What did the letter contain?
Of course he was right.
Do you have my note?
Yes, it did.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
It was a cold, dark night.
Be back in a minute.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
That is possible.
Oh, take those off.
And he told you nothing?
Then he must be a wonder.
Like these in shape and size?
Let him go free?
Wait a second.
Yes, said the old man.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Well yes, you are right.
Oh, all right.
The city was soon behind me.
Why did you bring him here?
Money is power.
Half the town was there.
They all fall to the ground.
Play the game out.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Oh, no.
You must stay with me.
Money is no object?
Perhaps he did.
Who gave it to you?
Come, let me show you my plan.
It was so long ago.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
And what a voice she has.
Dont laugh.
Oh, tell me.
Help me sit up.
Keep clear of him.
It was done.
Take good note of it.
Good to rest once in a way.
Did she fall?
The whole day had been hot.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
A fine thing too.
That was well done.
All that for nothing?
Just let us go free.
There is nothing more to be said.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Yes, all right.
Oh, just listen.
It might have done me good.
All right then, sit down.
Yes, to be sure.
And yet you are the better off?
It was very dark.
It must be done at once.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Is that possible?
Wonder what he does.
It was a kind of language between us.
It is nothing.
Wait for me.
There is your old bed.
Is my father in town?
Yes, you are right.
Just go to sleep.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Let her wait.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Oh, do as you like.
Will you rest here a little?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Did he fall?
Yes, sit down.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Sit down, he said.
His first cry was for his father.
Do you talk in your sleep?
It has to be done.
It is his voice.
Oh, that is very simple.
It must be done.
It is all done.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Yes, my love?
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
This voice was that of my father.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Yes, she said.
