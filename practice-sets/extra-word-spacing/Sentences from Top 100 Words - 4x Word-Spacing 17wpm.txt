Then how many are there?
Out of the way.
Now you know.
Who was he?
are you there?
But how is that?
He said no.
And is that all?
You have it.
What is he like?
But who was she?
She has it.
And could she see him?
What time is it?
And who are you?
You have them?
And who is this?
Then make it up.
Who will go first?
You may go.
Did you know him?
What can we do, then?
There he is, do you see him?
What would she have said?
Did you know her?
There is but one thing to do.
Now what are we to do with you?
You can have some.
Is he there?
Do you know what you look like?
Do you know?
But it has been so long.
What are we to do?
So it is.
and so on, and so on.
But WHAT DID you see?
Do you see him?
Can it be?
Do as you like.
How did you come by it?
Is it over?
Then there is more to do.
How long has he been there?
Do you see it?
What other way is there to look at it?
That was it.
What is it about?
And what did you see?
Is that it?
That is a long time.
Now there is no more to be said.
What do you make of that?
When was that?
One or two?
So there it was.
Do you like him?
Look over it.
And what did you do then?
How is she?
What is it all about?
Then who are you?
You know how it is with her.
How did she do it?
And do you like her?
How was that?
Did you see her?
What will you do, then?
And do you like him?
Has it come to this?
Tqhen you may go.
Is it time?
Who are you?
what is it?
The time will come.
What was it about?
What did they do?
Look at him.
How would you like to have it?
But when will that be?
Which is it?
When was it?
The time had come.
That was all she said.
Go on, he said.
Do you know her?
What are you up to?
And has it come to this?
There you are, he said.
but what if it is?
And who was that?
May we come in?
But so it is.
What was he like?
but we can go and see.
But what are you up to?
So it was.
And what do you call her?
That will do, said he.
Or so they said.
But will he see it?
What was it?
Look at them.
Then what are you up to now?
but there was more to it than this.
But it was of no use.
It was from you.
How is he now?
Then, how do you know?
Are you there?
Call him in.
How can it be?
What can this be?
Will you come and see her?
You can go.
You can do it.
So be it.
We have no water.
Come this way.
Who and what are you?
who, then, are you?
Is it like him?
No one will come, she said.
But what will you do?
How are you?
What do you make of it?
Look at it.
But he had to have it.
And what was it for?
When is it?
There were two of them.
Is that her?
Would you do what he did?
Do as you will.
We have him.
But what have they been up to?
Would you like some?
And how did you find out?
There they are.
No was there one?
Do you know him?
What did you do then?
How did he do it?
What DO you know of him?
who can it be?
That will do, he said.
And what is that?
You know more than we do.
What do you see?
What could it be?
Is that all?
Can you do that?
Had to look the other way.
What have you come for?
At what number?
There he is, you see.
That is what she did.
But how about you?
There you are.
At what time?
What is it like?
Did you know them?
How did you know about it?
Do they know him?
How is he?
Then what is it?
Now is your time.
But what is it?
Did you see it?
what has she to do with it?
Look at it this way.
Will that do?
Do you know what it is?
What is there to see?
And when will you call?
Who was that?
Can one see from there?
They said no more.
So that was the way.
How do you do?
What do they call you?
But he had no time.
And all for what?
There he is, she said.
What is that?
Who is she?
And what do you make of it?
What did he do to you?
Is she like him?
How can you know?
What is all this?
What is it for?
Has it come to this?
But will he see it?
It was from you.
How are you?
They said no more.
Then how many are there?
What could it be?
Is that all?
Which is it?
But it has been so long.
And do you like her?
Who and what are you?
are you there?
Had to look the other way.
But it was of no use.
You can go.
What other way is there to look at it?
Are you there?
So it is.
That is a long time.
What is it for?
Can it be?
What was it?
How did you know about it?
Is she like him?
who, then, are you?
We have him.
but there was more to it than this.
Can you do that?
There you are.
What is it all about?
How did he do it?
Then what is it?
Then, how do you know?
You may go.
Would you do what he did?
Now what are we to do with you?
So be it.
And what do you make of it?
And do you like him?
What are we to do?
That will do, he said.
No one will come, she said.
what is it?
And who are you?
What was it about?
Tqhen you may go.
So it was.
Is it time?
Come this way.
How was that?
You have them?
You know how it is with her.
There you are, he said.
Do they know him?
But what are you up to?
You have it.
Who was that?
That is what she did.
And what do you call her?
You can do it.
Did you know her?
Is it like him?
Call him in.
That will do, said he.
Do you see him?
What would she have said?
Do you know?
What do you make of that?
Who are you?
What is all this?
But what will you do?
Do you know what it is?
What can this be?
That was all she said.
How can it be?
Or so they said.
And what was it for?
what has she to do with it?
When is it?
There is but one thing to do.
When was that?
Do as you will.
Is he there?
No was there one?
Did you know them?
She has it.
You can have some.
What did they do?
What DO you know of him?
How can you know?
Who is she?
Will you come and see her?
And what did you see?
Then who are you?
And what is that?
But so it is.
Now you know.
May we come in?
Will that do?
And what did you do then?
But he had to have it.
What can we do, then?
Look at him.
Is it over?
What are you up to?
And who is this?
Do you know her?
Is that her?
That was it.
And has it come to this?
When was it?
But how is that?
Then make it up.
but what if it is?
There he is, you see.
One or two?
Do as you like.
Did you see it?
who can it be?
Do you know what you look like?
Can one see from there?
How did you come by it?
The time had come.
Then what are you up to now?
Do you see it?
At what time?
But WHAT DID you see?
And could she see him?
At what number?
Go on, he said.
Who was he?
What is that?
Look over it.
You know more than we do.
Who will go first?
What is there to see?
Then there is more to do.
and so on, and so on.
And how did you find out?
What will you do, then?
He said no.
Look at it.
What do you see?
There were two of them.
Now there is no more to be said.
But he had no time.
There they are.
We have no water.

The time will come.
Did you know him?
What is it about?
How do you do?
How is he now?
Look at it this way.
Would you like some?
What is it like?
How is she?
What was he like?
But who was she?
There he is, she said.
And who was that?
What have you come for?
And all for what?
but we can go and see.
How is he?
So that was the way.
But how about you?
But what have they been up to?
There he is, do you see him?
What did he do to you?
What time is it?
And when will you call?
But what is it?
And is that all?
Now is your time.
Out of the way.
Look at them.
What do you make of it?
Did you see her?
But when will that be?
What do they call you?
How would you like to have it?
How did she do it?
Do you know him?
