Where he was, no one knew.
And you will always love him?
You may leave the room.
Is the wind north or south?
You remember the place, my father?
Now listen to me.
The family was at home.
On fire, on fire.
He knew them.
Much of it was true.
What size do you want?
What do you mean by that question?
And will you direct us?
That was the question.
And you are still so young.
you know better than that.
A young man?
Let me also ask you a question.
Do you want any money?
It will interest you, said he.
What does he feel?
She is fast?
You are better than that.
Are you ready to play?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
It has been there ever since.
How many children did he leave?
Are you ready?
Have you told her?
And how did he make his money?
Made me feel so young.
Do you remember?
They had several children.
What have you heard?
Now, listen.
That is very simple.
Are you in love with her?
You will soon know.
You love him?
You are right, young man.
Had you heard?
In short, take me.
We were up early.
And dont talk to me.
Do you remember him?
How far from the body?
Young man, you will go far.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
To know her is to love her.
This is simple.
She was only a little girl.
Better cross here.
He has money.
You are on a ship?
She must be told.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Half a mile?
It was true to life.
you must step out.
That was the rule, she said.
They all heard me.
We will talk about that.
Against what side?
They had heard all that before.
It is a young girl.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
You were told.
But why must you leave me so soon?
He said, the work is now complete.
Listen to them, he said.
Let us pass.
Take good care of the little girl.
And serve them right.
Why talk to me?
Pull together.
From then on it was war between them.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
He will leave me.
What a question.
Is that true?
It is a rock.
Five young children.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Are you better?
She is very plain.
Never heard of it before.
We serve them.
Is your man white or black?
What have you against me now?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Let that pass.
How soon will he be here?
You are cold.
Are you here on leave?
Never heard of him.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
You will always love him?
No more money?
Before you leave, tell us.
Let me hear from you soon.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Then you will know me better.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
Are you all ready?
Ten will be early enough.
No less, no more.
Did you tell him your whole story?
He got it this morning.
They knew it.
She knew at once.
It is a fire.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
But listen to me.
If you only knew.
What is there to talk about?
Let us leave them, she said.
Has she any family?
When did this happen?
Let us talk a little about my father.
Did you get any money?
Listen to him.
Is it true?
Listen to me.
Was he young or old?
Half as many is too much.
No, he is a man about my size.
Hold it up to the light.
And so they knew that it was true.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Your true father?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
But enough of this.
Leave any for him?
Why do you serve?
How do you feel?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Does she go fast?
She was so young, too.
How does this happen?
The night was cold and still.
If you know it, that is enough.
Long and the short of it.
Answer me this one question.
It was cold.
You saw the person?
He had my love.
who told you you could?
A house is on fire?
Well, young man?
You are in love with me?
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
When do you leave?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Hold her hand.
But let that pass.
Light my fire.
We call it black.
They told me to.
That may be true.
The world is big enough.
I have no children to love me.
What is love?
You are a good girl.
How did this happen?
Let me see him, said the young man.
This money was for her.
She told me all about it.
How does it feel?
Can she sing?
He is very simple.
Your watch is slow.
You know me well enough.
Have you heard from him often?
What a state he was in.
So we came down this road.
We had better go in.
You are right, my love.
Then get ready at once.
No, my love.
Why do they want to make her sing?
Better late than never.
Where are you off to so early?
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
You can pass through the door.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Is your family well?
Are we ready?
It is cold.
There was no wind.
They can have all our half of the house.
Fire and water, earth and air.
And you can sing?
Read them, said the King.
Does he love you?
But what did we ever get for it?
It would be better if you went to the war.
Listen to this, will you?
Have you heard?
That would be the best way.
It was true.
She was a good girl.
You must leave that to me.
They are still young.
We knew them both.
The rock was very small.
About the usual time.
And what does she want the money for?
He never told us what it was she said.
In an hour?
In an hour it will be at the door.
Who was it told me his name?
Pass this way, then.
He never heard.
An hour and a half.
Can it be true?
How could that happen?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
As soon as you left, it began.
Did he though?
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Have you a family?
Put down three and carry five.
It is the rule.
Let us talk about you.
You had better go.
Pull it more to your side.
It was all she could do to hold in.
How do you feel now?
Look to the west.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Ten, did you say?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
We had a list.
Keep in step.
Better write it here.
A better man than you.
And then he told all he knew.
Who told you that?
It is true.
Are they made to order?
Little girl, where have you been?
Long live the king.
Every word you said was heard.
Did they ever go back?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
One other question, said he.
Let me remember what he said.
what could be better?
We got her half way.
Let this man pass.
Do you remember me?
An example would be better.
Do you know that old lay?
She is much better.
We dont know enough.
Had they been heard?
You had better come to my house, said the man.
You have an hour.
You may go, said the King.
What will happen to us?
He had enough of it.
Leave me out of the question.
Do you love her much?
She had very little notice from him.
And that is the whole point.
They left in the morning.
Can you sing?
So do you, my love.
The dog is always with him.
Why did it happen?
Leave off that.
This will pass in no time.
We are ready.
But he never heard me.
But how simple it is.
This is my body.
What will happen now?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
But listen to this, he said.
Do you love me?
Try it on the dog first.
This was true.
Are you still cold?
He said, get him out of the road.
Take a hold of it.
They had much to talk about.
She knew what was good for children.
But one day you must feel it.
The King Went to him.
What kind of a bird?
But she is very young.
It can never happen.
Do you own a dog?
We must make the best of it.
He put his hand over part of the map.
What can happen?
Never heard of it.
Remember that time?
That is enough for me.
It was a round table.
That is enough.
You must travel.
Feel better then.
Take notice.
Well, are you ready?
There are four hundred?
Will you answer that question?
It would have been more simple.
And so they began to talk.
So the question was, what to do?
you should know her better than me.
Who told you so?
That is true.
Where did they get the money from?
We took our leave early, and left together.
And why do you serve?
Ask them to sing one more song.
Which king?
That must be true.
She is the first person in this house.
He is better than any of you.
Then what would happen?
She told me to ask you.
Why do we love?
How short his time.
The night was cold.
