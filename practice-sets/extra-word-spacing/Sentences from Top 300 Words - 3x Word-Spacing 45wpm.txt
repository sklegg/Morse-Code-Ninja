Do you hear that?
By and by he got it.
She is still here?
And what did you learn from him?
Is it in the city?
It was the last day of the year.
But hard to tell.
Have you got that?
You took it.
Do you know where he is?
You got me?
Let us start, then.
Stop and think.
No, why should he?
It is always so.
Why dont you want to go?
There to the left.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Look at his face.
Who can answer for that?
He might still be up.
Let me get on with my work.
Will you never learn?
How many children?
She got up.
She might be at his house.
And then they began to fish.
Let me see it.
What did he answer?
But watch over him.
He came at once.
Who did you learn that from?
We got under way at last.
Who should it be?
Do you hear me?
This is real.
For once you are right.
It might help.
What do you think of the music?
The other night she left.
What is your real name?
It would seem so.
Stop, said he.
Let me look.
You are sure of it?
But now it is too late.
It was like new life to him.
Why, dont you hear it?
Let me get to work.
It is from your father.
One night more and he would be on his way.
And now, good night.
Do you have a car?
But it is all all too late now.
There was no letter for me.
Let me have a word with you.
Sure of what?
You must study.
Is my father here?
Where could you keep it?
He had two left feet.
What would you have me do with my life?
Right here it began.
Tell me more.
Here is the book.
We never thought of that.
Never see him again.
Let us go back.
Does he never go out?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
It is music.
So take care of me.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Let him follow me.
But she saw no one?
What a night it has been.
Let me out.
In the country?
He saw his men draw back.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
It is a long story.
It is so very kind of you both.
No, never.
Let them have it.
It will be too late.
There, do you hear?
This is my country.
But why dont you want to take it?
Are you my friend?
Who let you in?
Then, good night.
She saw it.
You found him?
Well, what next?
They never come back.
Good night, friend.
They came over last night.
What was it that you thought?
So they got out and went in.
He is always at it.
And why should they?
Why, is it late?
Let her go.
But it is the same with any life.
Come at once.
That was the first night.
You must never tell.
Why is he cross with me?
Do you know how he made his mark?
Let him grow up with you.
That is the idea.
Why, it was one of his own men.
Ask one of those men.
Here we see the boy at school.
This is what began it all.
Take care of him.
What do you hear?
Always the same with you people.
Do you have the letter?
He is at sea.
Which end is his head?
Cut him down.
They dont care.
Where is this city?
He had only one night more to live.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
We must go at once.
No, dont.
Let me go back.
Let me hear what it is.
And what did you do with that letter?
Well, run back to her.
Do you want some more to eat?
At four, she said.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Do you know what he did last night?
Come over in the sun.
They dont know their own country.
But it would be in the paper.
He is my father.
It is well thought of.
Let me see him at once.
Cut your hand open?
It was then time to start.
Is there any answer?
Good night again.
How much have you got?
We are together.
Watch over him.
But you must never tell.
Do you often come back?
Both of us.
Where have you been this long while?
And now let us go home.
Did you see his eye?
You have a car?
Then let me have a word with you.
She is my friend.
What country does he come from?
Here is the paper.
Let me hear your story.
Well, read the letter again.
Open the door.
Stop, let me show you the way.
A call for help, you thought?
We should look at this.
What did he say in the letter?
what river is it?
She must have a hard time with him.
Watch him, he said.
Off with her head.
Only, dont look back.
My father is right.
So, once more, good night.
Few had found it.
It was white.
Which story was it?
We might learn a thing or two.
At this time of my life, no.
Let me be and let me live.
Is he a real father?
We may be too late.
There were few near me.
Come let us see them.
Here is the letter.
Tell us a story.
Let me know at once when you will start.
They are always the same.
Just cut it out, will you?
Music is a good thing.
These were the first people we saw.
Dont say that to me.
To the left.
We got to let that go.
What was the name of the man who took it?
It was his own room.
That night we were just in time.
If you know, why dont you tell?
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
And then we may begin.
Is it far?
Write an answer.
Let me see him.
When did you begin?
Have you got it?
And he left the room.
No, stop.
You must eat now.
But then you would be close to the sea?
He then said, It is time to start.
Where has she run off to?
Come eat with me.
How could you let him go so far?
Dont you want any?
Dont move, he said.
And who is this friend?
Let us cross over.
Always the same, year after year.
How did it begin?
So he began to help.
But let us walk.
No, said her father.
What is life to you?
Who took him out of it?
Now or never.
The children will live just the same.
At last we have a man.
Think of my father.
Point it at his horse.
They are hard at it.
She saw no one?
How could you begin?
Let me go to the door.
Call the next one.
It must be in her own house.
Our own people must come first.
But it was very late.
Keep to the right.
What was left of him?
What did you hear?
He said at last.
This took place at his house, in his room.
It was very hard.
Why do you stop here?
What should he say?
What a start that was.
First turn to the left.
We got one and they got one.
And there are four of you?
Let me in.
Give me the letter.
You might want it.
And she left the room.
Have you been at sea?
You are right, father.
Let me say one thing.
But they may still come here.
Who said four?
Still, you never know.
Was you in my room?
You saw him?
She came in just now by the back door.
One was on a white horse.
And your children?
She came over last night.
Who found them out?
We dont see it like that.
Now let me have it.
What do you think when you hear music?
Where is the river?
Now you must eat.
But are you sure of that?
Are we too late?
No, said the Tree.
He could run no more.
Have you never been there?
One of us will be here all night.
Let me see her.
It is open?
Do you want to cross?
They always know.
Say good night.
We should ask him.
Let him answer us.
How would they stop it?
They never did it again.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
You are sure of that?
There is only food for one.
Life is all right.
Keep watch all night.
Any book will tell you that.
Who could have thought it?
A second man got up and went out.
Just cut it out.
Tell her to begin.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Come here, my friend.
Can you stand?
Let us go in.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Why should they?
Why dont you play?
She never came back.
Who was the letter from?
Are you sure?
Dont you think so?
We are very far from that.
How many are left?
He is my friend.
He has been been found.
Are you sure of it?
But you got to play music for them.
This took him some time.
He has children of his own.
it took all that time to come over the water.
Keep to the left.
Here he is at last.
He may come close.
Have you found it?
You should take me there one day.
Dont you like it?
Dont you see that?
But take care.
Can you hear me?
But what did you hear?
The sun had set long since.
We must begin again.
You will answer for it.
Do we stop here?
Good for the country.
Come, let us be men.
Dont tell me.
And this food?
Why should this be so?
You must walk.
Take care.
There are only four of us.
There was no answer.
They may tell us to open it.
But then it will be too late.
Go to your father.
Are we late?
See him grow up.
We were together.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
So it always was.
No, that can never be.
Off with his head.
One never has too much.
Just a few.
We found it.
Is that far?
