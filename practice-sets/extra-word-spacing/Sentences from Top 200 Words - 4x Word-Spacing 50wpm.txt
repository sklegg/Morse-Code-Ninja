What do you think of him?
There she is again.
Tell us your name.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
In what part of the house?
Come and help me.
Where are we?
How old are you?
But he does so need a mother.
where did she come from?
That is all one can say about her.
He will ask for it.
What would you have me do?
They had all been very good to us.
To what end?
How do you take it?
That would be very good.
You are a good boy.
But what does it mean?
What do you think of her?
The first act was over.
What on earth does this mean?
Can you help me find my way?
What a good thing it would be.
Why are they here?
And what about your mother?
What did he say?
Do you think she was?
Ask her, he said.
They are here.
Get to work.
Then what kind is it?
What you have just said is good, very good.
When will it take place?
But this is the point.
Which house is it?
Think what you will.
You know, you see right through people.
Think of him.
What does she want?
He said too much.
And what did she say?
Can you point it out to me?
Try it on.
Were you here before me?
He was so kind.
Where could he be?
Follow me, said the man.
There is more to tell.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
How could she say such a thing.
And where is this man?
That was a house to look at.
Ask him to show up?
What do you mean?
Put it on.
Well, what do you think about it?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Where does he live?
What is in your hand?
How can you find out?
Well then, tell him so.
You can help me here.
But why do you ask me?
And what are they made of?
Think no more about that.
Then they will follow you?
Will you take me to her?
Some day you may ask me about it.
Is it as good now?
It is very high.
You think so?
there are only two.
No, mother.
And what do you think?
She had to tell him.
Give it to me, then.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Good, he said.
Why is that?
Is it you or me?
How does she use you?
Well, how are you?
Good day to you.
Have you been here long?
There is the little boy.
Are you here for good?
Well, all right.
Why, what is it, then?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Will you try?
Look at it other way round.
Move on, then.
Well, did he?
Play with them.
How did you get me out?
Take this and this.
Give him air.
What on earth do you mean?
And how in the world did you find them?
Why, what do you mean?
Is that all you want?
Is there no one who can help me?
Why is he here?
Too much for me now.
That is the end of her.
Then will come our time.
You are most kind.
That is right.
He will live.
Good day, one and all.
It is very kind of you.
Can you take me?
What have you been after?
do you come from the end of the world?
Too much of this.
What do they want?
Where do you live?
Say what you want.
Come with me to the little house.
And in she went.
There was no one near.
What is that in your hand?
Is that right?
Now where did they come from?
He was at work again.
Tell us all about it.
There, that does me good.
Think it over.
How on earth do you know?
Why did he come?
But where is it?
Where are you from?
How long have you been here?
Are they like each other?
He was here.
Say no more about it.
Well, go on.
You are all very kind to me.
Hand it in.
You were near him.
Is she well?
He is at my house.
I would like to see her again in that.
And a very good thing, too.
What do you mean by that?
Just like me.
Well, and is that all?
What more could a man ask for?
One, two, three.
How did you get here?
You can say what it is.
Here is the way we put in the time.
What do you think of that?
Who is that man?
But what about me?
Why do you want to know?
Why are you like this?
But it is just so with the world.
Well, here he is.
She has a house?
Here it is.
It is great.
Here is my hand.
What do you play?
Well, read it.
Tell me about it.
Now it was time to act.
Where are you?
At your house?
And how old were you at that time?
This is my point.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Now we see the light.
It will take a little time.
Now, what do you want with me?
What did you say your name was?
What is his name?
Been back long?
Where are we to turn for help?
Give it me.
Where have you been?
What do you want?
And where is he now?
Well, how did it go?
But where are we to go?
Where in the world did you come from?
Call me what you will, he said.
Just look at her.
What does one live for?
What do they say was the cause?
See, here it is.
No, tell me.
What will you say?
That is just my point.
Now come here.
You must take me with you.
Why are you here?
And how did you find out?
Give me my work.
Here it is, he said.
Such as what?
Now, go home.
What do you want to ask these people?
And have you been here long?
Now tell me.
Did you tell him?
Would you now like to look round my place?
this one, too?
Now, you know me.
And off we go.
Take some, she said.
Just look through it.
Do you think so now?
It is all the same.
All in good time.
Very well, show him to me.
Who are these men?
Where to, now?
You see it every day.
Very well, he said.
Who will tell her?
How did that help you?
We are here.
How much do you want?
What does he mean?
Is it any good?
You are right.
What will each of you give?
Do you know me?
And they went home.
She was the cause of it all.
Come with me, then.
Give me a light.
Get out of the way.
He went to him.
What did he tell you?
And what is her name?
We must come back.
That was a good time.
Will you come with me?
There is no one here to see.
Large or small?
When will he come back?
What do you think of this?
But where is he?
Turn this way.
There will just be time.
How much are they?
And that was the end of it.
Look at me.
Well then, what do you want?
Give me more than that
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
How can you think of such a thing?
take them all.
What could set you off in the first place?
What could she mean by it?
And why is that?
When will her mother come?
And where is it?
What does all this mean?
You will get on in the world.
Do you want me to do it?
Do you think so?
It would be very kind of you.
What did you say that for?
Where are you off to?
Show me the way he went.
Where did you place it?
But what did you want?
Only two there now.
How does he use it?
This is the man.
Well, and what do you think?
But why do you ask?
Three, he said.
They want more.
And where is she, then?
And what was his name?
What was it you said to me?
Come with me.
Are you back again?
Is he big?
She came up to them.
For some man.
But you must.
Say no more.
Is it large?
It must be where you put it.
Time to get out.
He said that that would help.
Is there some for me?
What does it all mean?
Tell me his name.
She was right.
Where is she?
Is he a good man?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
After three, he said.
Show it to me.
And do you know why?
The world is before you.
What do you want me to do?
Read that, she said.
For how much?
You must come now.
Is this the man?
And what did he say?
Much good that would be.
That was very good.
In what year?
We will say no more about it, then.
How old was she?
It was high time.
She went on.
If you want to know, go and find out.
Give me your hand.
Where did he come from?
Where are they off to now?
How can you say that?
See, they are here.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Tell me all about it.
Read that, he said.
But he is right.
Here she is.
Too much in the way.
What was his name?
Then why are you here?
It is the same thing.
This is the first act.
There is no place like home.
Do it for me.
But who was your mother?
Go and try.
Where have they been?
Get out and play.
All right, then.
Show me the way.
Very well then.
And it did me good.
He was there too.
He has more to give.
We are who we say we are.
How can you tell?
Where is he?
He went on his way.
This for me?
You think so, too?
Tell me who made the world.
Are you at it again?
And what will they do with us?
That is right, said the old man.
Where do they get that?
Well, tell me.
Well, what do you think?
What is your name?
Where is he now?
She has been with him many long years.
You must tell me.
And where was the place?
Show us where you live, said the man.
And who is the man?
Is it all right?
What does she think about me?
There was work to do.
Why do you want water?
