When was it?
And what is that?
But it has been so long.
Now you know.
Do you know him?
What is it like?
And who are you?
What is there to see?
What was he like?
What time is it?
who, then, are you?
Go on, he said.
but there was more to it than this.
That is what she did.
Has it come to this?
What would she have said?
Would you like some?
Then there is more to do.
Look at it.
Do as you like.
That will do, he said.
And who is this?
No was there one?
What do you make of it?
There they are.
Do you see him?
What are we to do?
Can one see from there?
How did she do it?
Is he there?
Can you do that?
There he is, you see.
And what was it for?
What is it for?
and so on, and so on.
Will that do?
So it was.
No one will come, she said.
Did you know them?
What is he like?
How did he do it?
Look over it.
Now what are we to do with you?
What is it all about?
Then what is it?
One or two?
Who was that?
Is she like him?
Are you there?
Do they know him?
And what do you call her?
Then make it up.
Out of the way.
What did they do?
How was that?
And what did you see?
How do you do?
But WHAT DID you see?
There he is, do you see him?
She has it.
There is but one thing to do.
Or so they said.
what has she to do with it?
Will you come and see her?
How is she?
Call him in.
Do as you will.
How would you like to have it?
Did you know her?
You can have some.
What are you up to?
That will do, said he.
So that was the way.
Tqhen you may go.
There were two of them.
How did you know about it?
But what have they been up to?
Then what are you up to now?
And when will you call?
But he had no time.
And what do you make of it?
So it is.
Look at it this way.
You may go.
Which is it?
What is it about?
What other way is there to look at it?
How can it be?
But what are you up to?
Come this way.
Who are you?
but what if it is?
There he is, she said.
What DO you know of him?
At what number?
What is that?
Then, how do you know?
Do you know?
Did you see it?
What can we do, then?
So be it.
How did you come by it?
What did you do then?
When was that?
But when will that be?
But will he see it?
You can go.
How is he?
You know how it is with her.
When is it?
Is that it?
And could she see him?
How long has he been there?
They said no more.
The time had come.
What could it be?
May we come in?
But so it is.
Had to look the other way.
So there it was.
But who was she?
What can this be?
Is it over?
You know more than we do.
Who will go first?
And is that all?
Is it like him?
What have you come for?
And do you like her?
But how is that?
Can it be?
Then who are you?
What was it about?
There you are, he said.
You have them?
We have no water.
Now there is no more to be said.
Now is your time.
Do you like him?
That was all she said.
Is that her?
He said no.
It was from you.
We have him.
but we can go and see.
And do you like him?
Do you know what you look like?
And what did you do then?
are you there?
But it was of no use.
That is a long time.
Look at them.
Is it time?
Did you see her?
Look at him.
Then how many are there?
who can it be?
The time will come.
Do you know her?
You can do it.
You have it.
There you are.
What did he do to you?
What will you do, then?
Do you see it?
What do you make of that?
And has it come to this?
And how did you find out?
Who and what are you?
What do they call you?
But what is it?
At what time?
How is he now?
What was it?
That was it.
How can you know?
Do you know what it is?
But how about you?
And all for what?
But what will you do?
Did you know him?
what is it?
Would you do what he did?
What is all this?
Who is she?
How are you?
But he had to have it.
Is that all?
Who was he?
And who was that?
What do you see?
There he is, you see.
But WHAT DID you see?
Did you know them?
That will do, he said.
It was from you.
Now is your time.
who can it be?
Who are you?
Can you do that?
Who and what are you?
You can go.
what is it?
And what did you do then?
And has it come to this?
Did you know him?
We have no water.
and so on, and so on.
Had to look the other way.
What was he like?
Do as you like.
What is it for?
Will that do?
So it is.
But how is that?
Then what are you up to now?
How did he do it?
No was there one?
Now you know.
That will do, said he.
Are you there?
What will you do, then?
Look over it.
Do you know her?
What are you up to?
Who will go first?
But what have they been up to?
but we can go and see.
Is that her?
But will he see it?
How do you do?
But what is it?
What is all this?
What can this be?
One or two?
Did you know her?
Do you see him?
How are you?
who, then, are you?
How did you come by it?
There you are.
And what do you make of it?
Now what are we to do with you?
You can have some.
And could she see him?
Would you like some?
What did he do to you?
The time had come.
What time is it?
What can we do, then?
What is there to see?
Then make it up.
Is he there?
And all for what?
Is it over?
What is that?
What DO you know of him?
And do you like him?
What is it like?
What do you make of that?
At what time?
Do you know him?
You have them?
He said no.
And what was it for?
There you are, he said.
That is a long time.
What did they do?
Do you know what you look like?
At what number?
That is what she did.
What was it about?
But he had to have it.
And what do you call her?
Look at it this way.
You have it.
What do you see?
You know more than we do.
So that was the way.
How long has he been there?
Who was he?
And what did you see?
Call him in.
And what is that?
What have you come for?
Then who are you?
Look at it.
Do you like him?
That was it.
Go on, he said.
But it has been so long.
What is he like?
How did she do it?
And who are you?
Then how many are there?
How would you like to have it?
Look at them.
but what if it is?
Or so they said.
Did you see it?
And do you like her?
Look at him.
How can it be?
Is that all?
Come this way.
So be it.
But who was she?
There is but one thing to do.
How was that?
How did you know about it?
Tqhen you may go.
Do you see it?
Do they know him?
Who is she?
We have him.
Do you know?
You may go.
What could it be?
What do you make of it?
And who is this?
And is that all?
But how about you?
May we come in?
Now there is no more to be said.
So it was.
Is it time?
But so it is.
But when will that be?
Which is it?
But what are you up to?
Who was that?
What are we to do?
How is he?
No one will come, she said.
The time will come.
Will you come and see her?
They said no more.
Is she like him?
So there it was.
Do you know what it is?
There he is, do you see him?
That was all she said.
Has it come to this?
But he had no time.
There they are.
Would you do what he did?
How can you know?
What would she have said?
Then there is more to do.
Then what is it?
And when will you call?
What other way is there to look at it?
There were two of them.
Is that it?
but there was more to it than this.
Is it like him?
You can do it.
When was that?
How is he now?
How is she?
When is it?
But it was of no use.
What was it?
Did you see her?
Do as you will.
Out of the way.
And how did you find out?
And who was that?
But what will you do?

What is it all about?
When was it?
What is it about?
what has she to do with it?
Can one see from there?
What did you do then?
She has it.
What do they call you?
You know how it is with her.
Then, how do you know?
There he is, she said.
Can it be?
