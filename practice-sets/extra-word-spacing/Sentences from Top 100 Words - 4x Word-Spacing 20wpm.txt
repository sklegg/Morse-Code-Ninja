Out of the way.
And what is that?
Has it come to this?
Look at it this way.
Do you know?
So there it was.
Which is it?
You have them?
Or so they said.
What do they call you?
You have it.
She has it.
Will you come and see her?
Now you know.
And what was it for?
But how about you?
Is it over?
What was he like?
What did you do then?
We have him.
Do as you like.
But how is that?
Did you see her?
But when will that be?
That is a long time.
How did you know about it?
Who will go first?
What do you make of that?
You can do it.
And how did you find out?
Do you know her?
You know more than we do.
But what have they been up to?
Had to look the other way.
But it has been so long.
How is he?
but there was more to it than this.
Is it time?
There were two of them.
You may go.
Then, how do you know?
Who is she?
But he had no time.
and so on, and so on.
And what did you see?
Now there is no more to be said.
Do you know what you look like?
We have no water.
One or two?
You can have some.
but we can go and see.
Is she like him?
And do you like her?
What would she have said?
That will do, said he.
Look at it.
Can one see from there?
But it was of no use.
How do you do?
No was there one?
How can you know?
Can it be?
What do you see?
Look at them.
And what do you make of it?
Who are you?
But what are you up to?
Then how many are there?
Are you there?
What could it be?
How did you come by it?
Look over it.
And could she see him?
You know how it is with her.
Can you do that?
It was from you.
What is that?
When is it?
There he is, do you see him?
What is there to see?
Then there is more to do.
No one will come, she said.
There you are, he said.
What is he like?
At what time?
How can it be?
And what did you do then?
Who and what are you?
Is that it?
Then make it up.
are you there?
Did you know him?
Go on, he said.
He said no.
But so it is.
And do you like him?
How is she?
So it was.
Would you like some?
The time will come.
Look at him.
How are you?
What was it about?
Do they know him?
Is that all?
What is it all about?
Did you know her?
Now is your time.
Then what are you up to now?
What did he do to you?
who can it be?
And who is this?
What have you come for?
What other way is there to look at it?
Tqhen you may go.
The time had come.
What can we do, then?
Is he there?
So that was the way.
What is it like?
Did you see it?
Do as you will.
There is but one thing to do.
Did you know them?
May we come in?
But what is it?
But WHAT DID you see?
So it is.
Do you see it?
There he is, you see.
Do you see him?
What did they do?
You can go.
And is that all?
When was it?
Will that do?
What was it?
And has it come to this?
But will he see it?
what is it?
But who was she?
Now what are we to do with you?
There you are.
What are we to do?
There he is, she said.
Come this way.
And all for what?
What is it for?
That was it.
Then what is it?
That was all she said.
How is he now?
What are you up to?
Do you know what it is?
What can this be?
So be it.
Would you do what he did?
Is that her?
Who was he?
How was that?
What is it about?
What will you do, then?
They said no more.
There they are.
what has she to do with it?
And when will you call?
How did she do it?
And who are you?
How would you like to have it?
What is all this?
Who was that?
And what do you call her?
At what number?
How did he do it?
And who was that?
but what if it is?
That will do, he said.
Is it like him?
But he had to have it.
That is what she did.
who, then, are you?
Do you like him?
Then who are you?
What DO you know of him?
How long has he been there?
But what will you do?
Do you know him?
When was that?
Call him in.
What do you make of it?
What time is it?
Are you there?
but we can go and see.
Will you come and see her?
How did she do it?
What was he like?
Do as you like.
How would you like to have it?
Did you see it?
Is it time?
Will that do?
There he is, do you see him?
Do you see it?
who, then, are you?
There you are.
Tqhen you may go.
What are we to do?
So it was.
You can go.
and so on, and so on.
But what will you do?
You know more than we do.
What would she have said?
Then, how do you know?
What did he do to you?
At what time?
Did you know them?
May we come in?
And who are you?
Do as you will.
But what is it?
You can have some.
Look at them.
Is it over?
Come this way.
Do they know him?
How did he do it?
Who and what are you?
Look over it.
Do you see him?
Then what are you up to now?
Who is she?
Do you know what you look like?
What is he like?
You have it.
Then what is it?
What can we do, then?
And all for what?
And do you like her?
There is but one thing to do.
And who is this?
What is it about?
And when will you call?
What do you see?

Has it come to this?
When was it?
One or two?
Did you know her?
So be it.
What can this be?
Out of the way.
That is a long time.
But it was of no use.
But so it is.
What other way is there to look at it?
But how about you?
That was all she said.
But what have they been up to?
what has she to do with it?
Look at him.
There you are, he said.
How long has he been there?
But what are you up to?
Look at it.
And what was it for?
