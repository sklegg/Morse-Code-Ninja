Yes, said the old man.
Oh, of course.
How was it done?
Never mind me.
The night was very dark.
No, nothing at all.
Let us sit down.
And sit in the dark?
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
I hear his voice in the house.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Oh, this is too much.
And what a voice she has.
Oh, he is so kind.
Then all was dark again.
They would cry.
You can sleep here.
What is done is done.
Never mind that.
There, by the wheel.
The snow is deep.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
It has to be done.
You can hear that, miss?
There is no one in that room behind you.
Yes, but what did she say?
You brought no one with you?
Just let us go free.
Yes and no.
But what must be done?
Yes, go on.
Where can you wait for me?
Free to do what?
That is a fact.
Which box do you mean?
Is that possible?
Can it be possible?
Well, but where can he fly to?
Fine, very fine.
He had made up his mind.
You are in my power.
They call him a fine boy.
It is no use, said a voice.
But how long ago?
Leave the rest to me.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Oh, come now.
This is a test.
Clear the way.
Are they on foot?
He began to laugh.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Money is power.
Nothing had come of it.
There is a lot of people.
How can a little dog laugh?
All that for nothing?
There is nothing more to be said.
Let me see your plan.
She was still game.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Quick, friend, quick.
We are more strong together.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
It was cold and dark.
Do you have my note?
Who gave it to you?
He knew nothing.
Did he fall?
You knew it, and said nothing?
The night is so long, and yet so short.
All was dark.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
We must be quick.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Very well, wait a minute.
That was well done.
Let her wait.
Well yes, you are right.
Is he in bed?
It is very clear.
It was full of people.
Laugh, if you will.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
It was a very dark night.
He is in the box.
He must be in the same boat as us.
How is that done?
It was a dark night.
Do you see that island?
Of course it might.
Of course he was right.
Oh, nothing.
And here is the note.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Then he must be a wonder.
It was a kind of language between us.
Did it all rest on me?
Clear the table.
Yes, once.
Nothing she can eat?
Yes, sit down.
Yes, you are right.
What age is he?
Nothing new under the sun.
There was more to be done.
My mind was soon made up.
The city was soon behind me.
She got her hand free.
Well, miss?
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Why, of course.
But she is nothing to me now.
Dont laugh.
Let him go free?
What have they done?
Look at that dark water.
It is certain.
At his side was a large green box.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
You must have a rest.
It is nothing.
People might know my voice and find me out.
In that town there is a street.
It might have done me good.
But it must be done soon.
You love a certain person.
How long ago?
My mind is made up.
Now we must wait.
It was very dark.
But what then must be done?
A fine thing too.
What have they done with my work?
Take good note of it.
Yes, he said, all of it.
What did the letter contain?
Try to sleep.
Help me sit up.
Oh, to be sure.
We are free to act and think.
Nothing could be more simple.
He will sleep an hour.
It was a warm night.
Yes, he did.
In a minute.
Are you strong?
The old man gave no answer.
Yes, very well.
It is his voice.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Is it possible?
Oh, dont ask me.
Yes, to be sure.
They all fall to the ground.
Is it certain?
Of course it is.
Did she fall?
It is done.
Yes, but only for you and me.
It was done.
Oh, very well, he said.
Yes, he said.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
She began to cry.
He never said nothing.
The island was a mile long.
They know nothing about it.
He has a good voice still.
Oh, do as you like.
What can be done?
If only they would be quick.
Never mind how he came here.
Of course she will.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
He stood up.
Why should my father fly?
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Why did you bring him here?
Behind my bed.
Oh, if men only knew.
They need a rest.
The night was dark.
It was so very long ago.
But let us see your plan.
Yes, and no.
Oh, how can you sleep?
It must be done at once.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Better sit still.
But they could see nothing.
Her voice was low.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Yes, it did.
What more is to be done?
The little boy lay in his bed.
And yet you said he had money.
is it come yet?
His will be done.
What a game.
Nothing is more simple.
Come, let me show you my plan.
How was that possible?
Decide if you are going back home.
She gave me her hand.
Come quick.
Behind every book is a man.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
The water ran dry.
You are free to do so.
He is among us.
Oh, tell me.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Bring it here.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Perhaps he did.
The whole day had been hot.
Half the town was there.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Oh, no.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Oh, take me with you.
Wait and see.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
You must stay.
Wait a minute.
Who brought you up?
Money is no object?
Yes, we know that.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Oh let me in.
You know you must say yes.
He was here a minute ago.
It stood behind the door.
Be back in a minute.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Oh, man.
But that is nothing to us.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Yes, my love?
What brought you here?
See what you have done.
He ran up to them.
And then the game began all over again.
Yes, she could sing that.
Stay where you are.
Lead me to him.
Then lead the way.
Oh, that.
She heard and saw nothing.
We brought them in.
It was a record run.
You must stay with me.
Oh, you are there.
Oh, just listen.
What has he done?
Come, and we can rest together.
He left long ago.
Did she stay long?
Yes, she was back.
There is no possible way.
Well, what about my plan?
This made him wonder more and more.
Wait a second.
Well then, be quick.
Yes, of course.
Clear my name.
Yes, there it is.
Just go to sleep.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
But wait a minute.
Sit down, said the old man.
It is time for bed.
Well, sit down by me.
All of this was possible.
You better stay here all night.
Oh, go on.
Yes, she said.
Nothing at all.
Wonder what he does.
It is a real bed.
Oh, do the best you can.
Well, sit down.
It must be done.
It is all done.
Then bring them to me, she said.
And yet you are the better off?
Get to bed.
Play the game out.
It is possible.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
He saw nothing.
There is your old bed.
It was brought to me.
Wait for me.
Oh, that is very simple.
What is power?
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Like these in shape and size?
That would be a fine thing.
and so he decide he go back home.
How long would you keep me in town?
You will fall.
It was a cold, dark night.
Wonder is it like that.
Yes, go and find out.
His plan is very simple.
And you can do nothing until then?
Yes, it is true.
Oh, but you were there?
What has brought you here?
Yes, that is true.
Well, there he stood.
Yes, what is it?
Here is our plan.
Nothing could have been better.
Oh, take those off.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Then it is certain?
Again came the voice.
Yes, all right.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Is that a fact?
Good to rest once in a way.
Hold on a minute.
And what have you done to me?
This voice was that of my father.
All right then, sit down.
Oh, all right.
But never mind that.
Bring this with you.
Will you rest here a little?
What kind of voice is it?
Answer me that, miss.
He must wait.
His first cry was for his father.
He had, to be sure, done much.
What have you done?
Well, of course.
He gave me this paper.
Bring them here.
Keep clear of him.
That is possible.
Wonder if he has a name.
Oh, do you know?
Go and rest.
Sit down, he said.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Is my father in town?
Go in there and drive them out.
It was right in front of us.
Go back to bed.
It was so long ago.
Fly, my friend.
No, nothing of the kind.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
It was hot.
Of course they will.
You know nothing about it.
And he told you nothing?
