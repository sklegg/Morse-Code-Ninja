And where is this man?
Give him air.
But why do you ask?
take them all.
He was there too.
You were near him.
Well, what do you think about it?
What does one live for?
Here she is.
You are right.
Come with me.
Do you think so?
Where have they been?
That would be very good.
Where is she?
And what are they made of?
See, here it is.
What is in your hand?
In what part of the house?
Large or small?
And why is that?
Are you back again?
Here it is.
They are here.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
And do you know why?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
She came up to them.
Show me the way.
Do you know me?
But you must.
Good, he said.
That is the end of her.
Well then, tell him so.
We must come back.
Tell me all about it.
There was no one near.
Can you take me?
Then what kind is it?
What did he say?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Where are we to turn for help?
But where are we to go?
But he does so need a mother.
And a very good thing, too.
Did you tell him?
You know, you see right through people.
What do you think of this?
When will he come back?
There she is again.
Do you think so now?
Get out and play.
Who are these men?
Get out of the way.
We are who we say we are.
Look at it other way round.
How old was she?
And where is he now?
And it did me good.
How can you say that?
Can you help me find my way?
It is the same thing.
Are they like each other?
How much do you want?
But what does it mean?
How can you tell?
Well, did he?
But where is it?
The first act was over.
And how did you find out?
Look at me.
Here is my hand.
How can you find out?
There will just be time.
But what did you want?
Time to get out.
Come with me, then.
Then will come our time.
Well, all right.
Say no more.
The world is before you.
Tell me who made the world.
All right, then.
Why do you want to know?
It is all the same.
Is he a good man?
Very well, show him to me.
But what about me?
There, that does me good.
Give me more than that
Well, read it.
Show us where you live, said the man.
This is the first act.
What does she think about me?
Where are we?
You are all very kind to me.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Think of him.
For how much?
But why do you ask me?
He has more to give.
How do you take it?
She has a house?
Where did you place it?
Well, go on.
That is right, said the old man.
Then why are you here?
What more could a man ask for?
Are you here for good?
Where are they off to now?
He will live.
Where in the world did you come from?
And how old were you at that time?
That is just my point.
In what year?
Well, and what do you think?
You must come now.
Tell us your name.
Have you been here long?
Is she well?
What will you say?
Now where did they come from?
Well, and is that all?
Why are you like this?
How old are you?
Why is that?
Too much of this.
Can you point it out to me?
Tell me about it.
How much are they?
Take some, she said.
For some man.
How did that help you?
He said too much.
Very well then.
How could she say such a thing.
What on earth do you mean?
See, they are here.
Show it to me.
Just like me.
Give it me.
Then they will follow you?
He went to him.
Move on, then.
They had all been very good to us.
You can say what it is.
Would you now like to look round my place?
And what did she say?
And in she went.
What do you play?
After three, he said.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Is that all you want?
Now, what do you want with me?
Is that right?
Read that, she said.
But this is the point.
Will you come with me?
Some day you may ask me about it.
And where is it?
Where does he live?
He will ask for it.
What did you say your name was?
I would like to see her again in that.
Give it to me, then.
Why are they here?
This is my point.
She went on.
Try it on.
Very well, he said.
She was the cause of it all.
He was so kind.
What do they say was the cause?
And where is she, then?
How on earth do you know?
And who is the man?
where did she come from?
Well, how did it go?
What will each of you give?
And what was his name?
Think what you will.
Tell me his name.
Go and try.
Is he big?
Put it on.
Who will tell her?
And what will they do with us?
You are a good boy.
Well, what do you think?
What could set you off in the first place?
You must tell me.
He was here.
One, two, three.
Think no more about that.
To what end?
That is right.
There is the little boy.
Where do they get that?
Just look at her.
How does he use it?
Now come here.
He was at work again.
You can help me here.
do you come from the end of the world?
Too much in the way.
Think it over.
What was his name?
At your house?
Were you here before me?
He went on his way.
It is very high.
Is it any good?
Here it is, he said.
What does all this mean?
No, tell me.
How did you get me out?
What do you think of that?
It was high time.
You must take me with you.
What do you want me to do?
Give me my work.
Why is he here?
Well, here he is.
Get to work.
How can you think of such a thing?
All in good time.
What was it you said to me?
Where do you live?
It is great.
That was a good time.
When will her mother come?
What does she want?
You see it every day.
And have you been here long?
Is there no one who can help me?
Do you want me to do it?
Where could he be?
You will get on in the world.
No, mother.
Take this and this.
But he is right.
There is more to tell.
It must be where you put it.
It will take a little time.
Well then, what do you want?
Play with them.
Do you think she was?
Is it all right?
Much good that would be.
It is very kind of you.
That is all one can say about her.
Is there some for me?
There was work to do.
Been back long?
You think so?
Where have you been?
But who was your mother?
Come with me to the little house.
Is it you or me?
Why, what do you mean?
That was a house to look at.
Here is the way we put in the time.
What you have just said is good, very good.
But it is just so with the world.
And where was the place?
Just look through it.
Well, tell me.
Ask him to show up?
If you want to know, go and find out.
Now it was time to act.
What do you mean?
Come and help me.
And how in the world did you find them?
What would you have me do?
He is at my house.
Will you take me to her?
What a good thing it would be.
Where is he now?
Well, how are you?
What have you been after?
Where did he come from?
Why did he come?
Who is that man?
Where are you from?
And they went home.
Tell us all about it.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Do it for me.
Three, he said.
Which house is it?
What could she mean by it?
Where are you off to?
Where are you?
Turn this way.
What do you think of him?
You think so, too?
Now, you know me.
What do you mean by that?
We will say no more about it, then.
But where is he?
What did you say that for?
Now, go home.
Are you at it again?
When will it take place?
This is the man.
What does it all mean?
You are most kind.
This for me?
Give me your hand.
Why do you want water?
Only two there now.
Why, what is it, then?
And off we go.
What is his name?
Good day to you.
There is no one here to see.
How did you get here?
There is no place like home.
What do you want?
And what did he say?
Call me what you will, he said.
this one, too?
Where to, now?
What is that in your hand?
Say no more about it.
What is your name?
He said that that would help.
They want more.
Is it large?
Where is he?
Follow me, said the man.
Give me a light.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Why are you here?
Is it as good now?
What do they want?
And what is her name?
What does he mean?
Too much for me now.
Say what you want.
Will you try?
Now we see the light.
Is this the man?
there are only two.
She was right.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
We are here.
How does she use you?
What on earth does this mean?
She had to tell him.
Show me the way he went.
Now tell me.
Such as what?
What did he tell you?
And that was the end of it.
That was very good.
Read that, he said.
Ask her, he said.
It would be very kind of you.
What do you want to ask these people?
Hand it in.
And what do you think?
It was now his turn to look about him.
How long have you been here?
What do you think of her?
Good day, one and all.
And what about your mother?
She has been with him many long years.
