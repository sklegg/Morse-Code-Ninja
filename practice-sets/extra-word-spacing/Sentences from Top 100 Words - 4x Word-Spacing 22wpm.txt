What other way is there to look at it?
That was all she said.
You have them?
There is but one thing to do.
You have it.
What did they do?
That is a long time.
but we can go and see.
Then who are you?
No was there one?
Do you see it?
Do you like him?
Do you know what you look like?
Is it over?
Tqhen you may go.
There you are.
Now what are we to do with you?
who, then, are you?
Now is your time.
Is it like him?
Did you see her?
How did he do it?
When was that?
There he is, she said.
How are you?
What was he like?
How did she do it?
Do you see him?
Look at them.
You know how it is with her.
And what do you call her?
What do you make of it?
What did you do then?
But who was she?
What can this be?
How long has he been there?
But what is it?
What would she have said?
And could she see him?
Did you know her?
Go on, he said.
There they are.
Had to look the other way.
Who was he?
And who was that?
And what do you make of it?
Do you know what it is?
But he had no time.
What is all this?
How was that?
And what did you see?
Look at it this way.
Who was that?
Look at him.
Call him in.
Then how many are there?
But it has been so long.
Now you know.
What is it for?
What do you see?
What is it all about?
Is that all?
What can we do, then?
How is he?
And all for what?
You can have some.
What is there to see?
We have no water.
Who are you?
Or so they said.
Out of the way.
At what number?
There were two of them.
But he had to have it.
What did he do to you?
Look over it.
But will he see it?
And what is that?
And has it come to this?
Is it time?
So it is.
what is it?
That was it.
Has it come to this?
You can do it.
Do you know her?
What have you come for?
How do you do?
She has it.
Can it be?
Who is she?
And is that all?
At what time?
Did you know them?
What was it?
How would you like to have it?
Then what is it?
Now there is no more to be said.
Do as you will.
Look at it.
but there was more to it than this.
Do you know?
What is that?
And what was it for?
How is she?
So that was the way.
who can it be?
What will you do, then?
What DO you know of him?
But it was of no use.
And who is this?
what has she to do with it?
What time is it?
You may go.
And do you like him?
Would you like some?
But WHAT DID you see?
What was it about?
Is she like him?
What is it like?
When was it?
Which is it?
Are you there?
But what will you do?
What do they call you?
There he is, do you see him?
but what if it is?
And who are you?
How did you know about it?
Did you know him?
How is he now?
But so it is.
Is that her?
and so on, and so on.
And what did you do then?
But what are you up to?
What is it about?
There he is, you see.
are you there?
What do you make of that?
There you are, he said.
So there it was.
And how did you find out?
But how is that?
Then what are you up to now?
Then make it up.
But how about you?
How can you know?
Is he there?
Would you do what he did?
Then, how do you know?
May we come in?
What could it be?
So be it.
Do you know him?
The time had come.
And when will you call?
When is it?
It was from you.
Is that it?
You can go.
That will do, he said.
Will you come and see her?
Come this way.
What are we to do?
No one will come, she said.
We have him.
So it was.
Then there is more to do.
And do you like her?
Who and what are you?
What are you up to?
How did you come by it?
Can one see from there?
The time will come.
How can it be?
He said no.
Did you see it?
What is he like?
One or two?
They said no more.
But what have they been up to?
You know more than we do.
Who will go first?
Can you do that?
Do they know him?
Will that do?
But when will that be?
That will do, said he.
That is what she did.
Do as you like.
There is but one thing to do.
How is he now?
Who was that?
At what number?
But what will you do?
And what is that?
Out of the way.
Look over it.
Look at them.
