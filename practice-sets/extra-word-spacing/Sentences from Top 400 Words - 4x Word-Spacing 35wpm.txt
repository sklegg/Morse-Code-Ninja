Do you remember me?
And that is the whole point.
Can she sing?
Let us talk about you.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Take a hold of it.
What a question.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
They told me to.
He had enough of it.
She must be told.
Leave me out of the question.
And dont talk to me.
Before you leave, tell us.
And so they began to talk.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
But listen to this, he said.
Where did they get the money from?
It was true to life.
This was true.
That is very simple.
Are you ready to play?
Look to the west.
Has she any family?
We call it black.
He will leave me.
How do you feel?
The night was cold and still.
It has been there ever since.
The rock was very small.
We got her half way.
A young man?
Every word you said was heard.
Young man, you will go far.
But how simple it is.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Are you better?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
From then on it was war between them.
It is cold.
Listen to him.
Hold it up to the light.
And how did he make his money?
Are they made to order?
No, my love.
We serve them.
Much of it was true.
Have you heard from him often?
How do you feel now?
Do you remember?
Never heard of it before.
As soon as you left, it began.
We must make the best of it.
To know her is to love her.
She was a good girl.
If you know it, that is enough.
Have you told her?
No less, no more.
Now, listen.
Put down three and carry five.
You will always love him?
Well, are you ready?
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
A better man than you.
And so they knew that it was true.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Are you here on leave?
Pull it more to your side.
An example would be better.
Leave off that.
you must step out.
It was all she could do to hold in.
Why do you serve?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Better late than never.
Are you all ready?
What size do you want?
So the question was, what to do?
She is fast?
We dont know enough.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Long and the short of it.
So do you, my love.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Why do we love?
Who told you that?
No, he is a man about my size.
She was so young, too.
Had they been heard?
Remember that time?
Let this man pass.
Was he young or old?
Little girl, where have you been?
Did you get any money?
What is love?
An hour and a half.
And serve them right.
Do you remember him?
It is a young girl.
We had better go in.
How could that happen?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
And you will always love him?
It was true.
She knew what was good for children.
We are ready.
You may leave the room.
Listen to them, he said.
We were up early.
She is very plain.
There was no wind.
What is there to talk about?
Have you heard?
He is better than any of you.
He has money.
How far from the body?
You are better than that.
She is the first person in this house.
What have you heard?
How many children did he leave?
Let us pass.
I have no children to love me.
Hold her hand.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Did he though?
Take notice.
Do you love me?
Light my fire.
Well, young man?
Half a mile?
Try it on the dog first.
That would be the best way.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
You will soon know.
No more money?
And will you direct us?
That was the question.
You are a good girl.
Are you still cold?
Have you a family?
We had a list.
Is your man white or black?
He said, get him out of the road.
This money was for her.
But he never heard me.
You must leave that to me.
And why do you serve?
How does this happen?
He said, the work is now complete.
When do you leave?
That must be true.
Then you will know me better.
It would have been more simple.
He put his hand over part of the map.
Better write it here.
You love him?
What have you against me now?
How did this happen?
what could be better?
You must travel.
Let us leave them, she said.
But let that pass.
The world is big enough.
You were told.
He got it this morning.
She had very little notice from him.
Will you answer that question?
Do you love her much?
Which king?
It is a rock.
Had you heard?
They had several children.
But one day you must feel it.
Is the wind north or south?
She is much better.
Then get ready at once.
Never heard of it.
They left in the morning.
This is my body.
Is it true?
He never told us what it was she said.
How soon will he be here?
That was the rule, she said.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
What does he feel?
But why must you leave me so soon?
But she is very young.
Let me hear from you soon.
Can it be true?
who told you you could?
This is simple.
You are right, my love.
Take good care of the little girl.
If you only knew.
A house is on fire?
She knew at once.
They can have all our half of the house.
Are you ready?
And you are still so young.
Does she go fast?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
She was only a little girl.
What can happen?
It was a round table.
And you can sing?
They all heard me.
Ten will be early enough.
It can never happen.
On fire, on fire.
In an hour?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
It is the rule.
We knew them both.
So we came down this road.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
You are cold.
Can you sing?
Where are you off to so early?
It will interest you, said he.
Better cross here.
Who told you so?
Let me also ask you a question.
Never heard of him.
And then he told all he knew.
He knew them.
That is enough for me.
She told me all about it.
Listen to this, will you?
Let me remember what he said.
He had my love.
Fire and water, earth and air.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
Pass this way, then.
Answer me this one question.
Then what would happen?
Is that true?
You are in love with me?
You are on a ship?
You may go, said the King.
Long live the king.
But enough of this.
How does it feel?
Ask them to sing one more song.
Do you own a dog?
You had better go.
Pull together.
It would be better if you went to the war.
They knew it.
This will pass in no time.
Listen to me.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Do you know that old lay?
You can pass through the door.
Your true father?
Do you want any money?
Your watch is slow.
The night was cold.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Are you in love with her?
But what did we ever get for it?
Is your family well?
The family was at home.
Why do they want to make her sing?
That is true.
She told me to ask you.
When did this happen?
But listen to me.
He never heard.
You know me well enough.
Now listen to me.
It was cold.
You have an hour.
What a state he was in.
Ten, did you say?
About the usual time.
What kind of a bird?
Who was it told me his name?
Did you tell him your whole story?
The King Went to him.
Against what side?
Keep in step.
The dog is always with him.
He is very simple.
Made me feel so young.
Does he love you?
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Why did it happen?
They had heard all that before.
We will talk about that.
Leave any for him?
Five young children.
It is a fire.
What will happen to us?
Half as many is too much.
That may be true.
Let me see him, said the young man.
They had much to talk about.
There are four hundred?
Did they ever go back?
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
That is enough.
Feel better then.
It is true.
You saw the person?
In short, take me.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
You remember the place, my father?
Let us talk a little about my father.
How short his time.
And what does she want the money for?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
you should know her better than me.
Where he was, no one knew.
Why talk to me?
You are right, young man.
Are we ready?
What do you mean by that question?
They are still young.
One other question, said he.
What will happen now?
Let that pass.
you know better than that.
Read them, said the King.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
