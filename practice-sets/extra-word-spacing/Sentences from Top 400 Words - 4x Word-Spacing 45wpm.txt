Has she any family?
Made me feel so young.
The night was cold and still.
How does this happen?
Ten, did you say?
The night was cold.
From then on it was war between them.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
You are a good girl.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Is your man white or black?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
He knew them.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
We must try to find him, said the girl.
She is fast?
And will you direct us?
She knew at once.
And so they knew that it was true.
She had very little notice from him.
You remember the place, my father?
When do you leave?
Is the wind north or south?
Your watch is slow.
You are cold.
The King Went to him.
How soon will he be here?
He said, the work is now complete.
Have you told her?
Ten will be early enough.
Did they ever go back?
Better write it here.
Ask them to sing one more song.
About the usual time.
And serve them right.
Pull it more to your side.
They can have all our half of the house.
Let me see him, said the young man.
But how simple it is.
Have you heard?
It would have been more simple.
You are in love with me?
Fire and water, earth and air.
Then what would happen?
Let us leave them, she said.
But why must you leave me so soon?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
When did this happen?
Listen to him.
Hold her hand.
Why did it happen?
That is very simple.
what could be better?
We had better go in.
Do you love me?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Can she sing?
You must travel.
Long live the king.
What size do you want?
She knew what was good for children.
You may go, said the King.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Keep in step.
They all heard me.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
Let me hear from you soon.
And so they began to talk.
They left in the morning.
Take a hold of it.
But listen to this, he said.
You will soon know.
Have you heard from him often?
We will talk about that.
Take good care of the little girl.
It is cold.
And you are still so young.
Who was it told me his name?
But enough of this.
We were up early.
On fire, on fire.
We must make the best of it.
Listen to them, he said.
She must be told.
We got her half way.
This was true.
Who told you so?
There was no wind.
We took our leave early, and left together.
It is the rule.
Then get ready at once.
And you can sing?
What does he feel?
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Are they made to order?
She is much better.
How short his time.
Did you tell him your whole story?
Do you love her much?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
It is a rock.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Are you here on leave?
They are still young.
You have an hour.
Half a mile?
You must leave that to me.
He put his hand over part of the map.
Leave off that.
Now, listen.
Let that pass.
Half as many is too much.
It would be better if you went to the war.
Can you sing?
He never told us what it was she said.
And that is the whole point.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
In an hour it will be at the door.
You may leave the room.
Before you leave, tell us.
They had heard all that before.
Answer me this one question.
Was he young or old?
He is better than any of you.
Never heard of it.
You are right, young man.
But one day you must feel it.
Never heard of it before.
Against what side?
We dont know enough.
Long and the short of it.
Well, young man?
What will happen to us?
What have you heard?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Why talk to me?
What a state he was in.
It was all she could do to hold in.
The world is big enough.
Leave any for him?
That would be the best way.
She is very plain.
To know her is to love her.
Little girl, where have you been?
What is there to talk about?
Light my fire.
I have no children to love me.
In an hour?
There are four hundred?
Better late than never.
A young man?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
What can happen?
We had a list.
who told you you could?
Let us talk about you.
This money was for her.
you should know her better than me.
But he never heard me.
He is very simple.
No more money?
It is a fire.
A better man than you.
Does she go fast?
Put down three and carry five.
This is simple.
Never heard of him.
Did he though?
Let us pass.
What have you against me now?
You are better than that.
Now listen to me.
Then you will know me better.
Do you remember me?
That may be true.
They told me to.
It was cold.
Had they been heard?
You are right, my love.
It will interest you, said he.
Let me also ask you a question.
Are we ready?
Do you know that old lay?
Did you get any money?
They had much to talk about.
Better cross here.
Does he love you?
How did this happen?
So do you, my love.
They knew it.
Try it on the dog first.
You had better go.
One other question, said he.
She told me to ask you.
Take notice.
If you know it, that is enough.
She is the first person in this house.
She was so young, too.
Pass this way, then.
He never heard.
But listen to me.
This is my body.
It was true.
You can pass through the door.
Do you remember?
He will leave me.
How does it feel?
Where did they get the money from?
The rock was very small.
Young man, you will go far.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
That is enough.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Read them, said the King.
An example would be better.
Are you better?
And then he told all he knew.
Is your family well?
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
How many children did he leave?
As soon as you left, it began.
Can it be true?
No less, no more.
Have you a family?
Is it true?
If you only knew.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Who told you that?
You love him?
Listen to me.
A house is on fire?
The dog is always with him.
But let that pass.
They had several children.
That must be true.
No, he is a man about my size.
It is a young girl.
Is that true?
It is true.
No, my love.
Had you heard?
That was the question.
Where he was, no one knew.
She was a good girl.
It was a round table.
Every word you said was heard.
He has money.
You were told.
And how did he make his money?
We call it black.
You saw the person?
She was only a little girl.
He had my love.
Hold it up to the light.
Will you answer that question?
And what does she want the money for?
you know better than that.
It has been there ever since.
Five young children.
Leave me out of the question.
Let me remember what he said.
Look to the west.
That is enough for me.
Why do they want to make her sing?
What is love?
Much of it was true.
This will pass in no time.
Why do we love?
What kind of a bird?
We are ready.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
How do you feel?
Why do you serve?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Which king?
Are you all ready?
Do you remember him?
You will always love him?
How could that happen?
How do you feel now?
How far from the body?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
An hour and a half.
We serve them.
It can never happen.
That is true.
Where are you off to so early?
Let this man pass.
So the question was, what to do?
He said, get him out of the road.
What will happen now?
In short, take me.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
You know me well enough.
She told me all about it.
And you will always love him?
And dont talk to me.
Are you in love with her?
Feel better then.
Do you own a dog?
And why do you serve?
What a question.
Are you ready?
But what did we ever get for it?
Well, are you ready?
Are you ready to play?
You are on a ship?
Do you want any money?
That was the rule, she said.
It was true to life.
We knew them both.
He had enough of it.
The family was at home.
He got it this morning.
Let us talk a little about my father.
you must step out.
Remember that time?
Listen to this, will you?
Your true father?
But she is very young.
What do you mean by that question?
Pull together.
Are you still cold?
You have your whole life before you, she said.
So we came down this road.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
