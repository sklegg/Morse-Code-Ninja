You must study.
Let me get to work.
And she left the room.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Here he is at last.
Let him follow me.
It is always so.
For once you are right.
We must begin again.
Always the same, year after year.
He saw his men draw back.
Let me look.
Was you in my room?
He is always at it.
Sure of what?
There are only four of us.
He is at sea.
Cut your hand open?
Why should they?
Why is he cross with me?
Take care.
We must go at once.
There were few near me.
Let me say one thing.
We might learn a thing or two.
Take care of him.
Come at once.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Let me out.
You are sure of it?
It must be in her own house.
Are we too late?
Well, let us be sure of that.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
You should take me there one day.
Still, you never know.
Do you know where he is?
We may be too late.
This is what began it all.
She might be at his house.
What country does he come from?
Where could you keep it?
What should he say?
But take care.
So, once more, good night.
What do you think when you hear music?
Dont you think so?
This is my country.
Where has she run off to?
What do you think of the music?
But it would be in the paper.
Off with his head.
It might help.
Did you see his eye?
They dont care.
My father is right.
But she saw no one?
So they got out and went in.
Any book will tell you that.
Let him answer us.
How much have you got?
Let him grow up with you.
He said at last.
Tell her to begin.
You are sure of that?
There was no letter for me.
And now, good night.
Just set still and take it like a man.
And your children?
It was white.
Just cut it out, will you?
Keep to the right.
Have you found it?
And what did you do with that letter?
She is still here?
Both of us.
One was on a white horse.
Do you hear me?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Who could have thought it?
One night more and he would be on his way.
But now it is too late.
Do you know how he made his mark?
No, why should he?
It is open?
Dont you want any?
He had only one night more to live.
Can you stand?
He has children of his own.
it took all that time to come over the water.
Think of my father.
But it was very late.
Now let me have it.
Let me go back.
How could you begin?
There is only food for one.
You will answer for it.
Do you know what he did last night?
She must have a hard time with him.
At this time of my life, no.
They dont know their own country.
No, that can never be.
Why, dont you hear it?
You got me?
She came over last night.
Where have you been this long while?
How would they stop it?
Just a few.
Good night, friend.
What a start that was.
Is my father here?
What a night it has been.
Well, run back to her.
What did you hear?
Let me see her.
So it always was.
Let me hear what it is.
Now or never.
One of us will be here all night.
We got under way at last.
She saw it.
Let us go back.
Good night again.
We found it.
At last we have a man.
Do you want some more to eat?
Have you never been there?
Why dont you want to go?
Let them have it.
Why do you stop here?
How did it begin?
There to the left.
We were together.
And now let us go home.
Who took him out of it?
And what did you learn from him?
You might want it.
This took him some time.
What would you have me do with my life?
Here we see the boy at school.
Here is the letter.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
How many are left?
It was the first thing he thought of.
That was the first night.
Who can answer for that?
So take care of me.
Stop and think.
He has been been found.
So he began to help.
What did he say in the letter?
He is my friend.
There, do you hear?
See him grow up.
Dont tell me.
What was the name of the man who took it?
Do you have a car?
It is a long story.
The sun had set long since.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
You have a car?
This is real.
But it is all all too late now.
But why dont you want to take it?
What was left of him?
When did you begin?
We are together.
They may tell us to open it.
No, said the Tree.
It was then time to start.
We should ask him.
Is there any answer?
You are right, father.
Watch him, he said.
That is the idea.
Where is the river?
Dont say that to me.
Right here it began.
They are hard at it.
It was very hard.
Ask one of those men.
Off with her head.
Which story was it?
Who said four?
Call the next one.
Tell us a story.
At four, she said.
We are very far from that.
No, never.
Well, what next?
It is music.
Does he never go out?
Let her go.
It was his own room.
But then it will be too late.
One never has too much.
Let me hear your story.
Let me get on with my work.
First turn to the left.
You must eat now.
Is it far?
Do you have the letter?
Why, it was one of his own men.
They always know.
He came at once.
Are we late?
Let me see him at once.
What is your real name?
Let me go to the door.
A second man got up and went out.
Go to your father.
You found him?
They came over last night.
Only, dont look back.
And there are four of you?
You must walk.
No, said her father.
In the country?
Is that far?
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Come here, my friend.
It would seem so.
Let me be and let me live.
You saw him?
They never did it again.
Have you got it?
But it is the same with any life.
Point it at his horse.
Watch over him.
Dont you see that?
Who was the letter from?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Are you sure of it?
She came in just now by the back door.
He then said, It is time to start.
No, stop.
Do we stop here?
We dont see it like that.
Who did you learn that from?
The children will live just the same.
She saw no one?
Let us cross over.
Come, let us be men.
It was like new life to him.
And he left the room.
Few had found it.
Let me see him.
Who should it be?
Let me know at once when you will start.
Is it in the city?
And then they began to fish.
Have you been at sea?
Write an answer.
Will you never learn?
Just cut it out.
Who found them out?
Why should this be so?
We got one and they got one.
Life is all right.
You must never tell.
We never thought of that.
Stop, let me show you the way.
Come eat with me.
No, dont.
Open the door.
Do you want to cross?
Cut him down.
A call for help, you thought?
Who let you in?
It is from your father.
They never come back.
And this food?
It was the last day of the year.
Tell me more.
Are you sure?
Do you often come back?
She never came back.
And who is this friend?
And then we may begin.
She is my friend.
Then let me have a word with you.
Never see him again.
He could run no more.
Well, read the letter again.
That night we were just in time.
Keep to the left.
How could you let him go so far?
He is my father.
But hard to tell.
Music is a good thing.
Let me in.
It will be too late.
Look at his face.
We should look at this.
We got to let that go.
Stop, said he.
Here is the book.
But watch over him.
Let us go in.
By and by he got it.
Let me see it.
What did he answer?
But are you sure of that?
What is life to you?
He may come close.
It is well thought of.
You took it.
Dont move, he said.
How many children?
what river is it?
Then, good night.
Do you hear that?
But then you would be close to the sea?
Why, is it late?
Are you my friend?
She got up.
Come let us see them.
Here is the paper.
And why should they?
Keep watch all night.
Now you must eat.
Always the same with you people.
But what did you hear?
He might still be up.
Have you got that?
What was it that you thought?
Give me the letter.
But they may still come here.
They are always the same.
Say good night.
Our own people must come first.
Is he a real father?
To the left.
Which end is his head?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Where is this city?
These were the first people we saw.
What do you hear?
Let me have a word with you.
There was no answer.
But you must never tell.
Can you hear me?
Dont you like it?
He had two left feet.
The other night she left.
Let us start, then.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Come over in the sun.
Why dont you play?
But let us walk.
But you got to play music for them.
It is so very kind of you both.
Good for the country.
