Or so they said.
But it has been so long.
But what are you up to?
May we come in?
What do you make of it?
One or two?
Who was that?
who can it be?
When was it?
Who was he?
How did she do it?
There you are.
How would you like to have it?
There he is, you see.
Look at them.
Did you know them?
There they are.
Is it over?
We have no water.
And who are you?
Do you see it?
Look at him.
Do you know him?
What will you do, then?
That is what she did.
But so it is.
What did they do?
but there was more to it than this.
You know more than we do.
What is that?
There he is, do you see him?
Who is she?
What other way is there to look at it?
What is all this?
Go on, he said.
What was he like?
Out of the way.
Do you see him?
There were two of them.
Now is your time.
Will that do?
Would you do what he did?
but we can go and see.
At what number?
When was that?
But will he see it?
Is it time?
Now you know.
And what was it for?
What did he do to you?
How did he do it?
Do you know what it is?
What DO you know of him?
what is it?
Is she like him?
It was from you.
Look at it this way.
Who are you?
That will do, said he.
But when will that be?
How can it be?
Come this way.
Do you know what you look like?
You know how it is with her.
Now there is no more to be said.
And has it come to this?
How did you know about it?
What are we to do?
How was that?
What time is it?
So that was the way.
And all for what?
At what time?
But he had to have it.
But it was of no use.
Now what are we to do with you?
But who was she?
And is that all?
So there it was.
We have him.
Then who are you?
What is it like?
What did you do then?
Look at it.
When is it?
Then what is it?
Do they know him?
Then how many are there?
There he is, she said.
What do you see?
Then what are you up to now?
And how did you find out?
You may go.
How is she?
What do they call you?
What are you up to?
What is it all about?
Do you know?
So be it.
Is that all?
You can go.
Is that her?
Will you come and see her?
They said no more.
What have you come for?
Do you know her?
There is but one thing to do.
What could it be?
That is a long time.
are you there?
Do as you like.
who, then, are you?
What is there to see?
And could she see him?
but what if it is?
You have them?
Call him in.
Do you like him?
Is that it?
The time will come.
You can do it.
What is it for?
Did you see her?
You have it.
But what is it?
What do you make of that?
Look over it.
How is he?
That will do, he said.
Tqhen you may go.
Has it come to this?
How did you come by it?
And do you like her?
What was it about?
Who and what are you?
No one will come, she said.
Is he there?
And what is that?
That was all she said.
How long has he been there?
Do as you will.
Had to look the other way.
That was it.
And who is this?
The time had come.
There you are, he said.
So it is.
How do you do?
Can you do that?
But what have they been up to?
And who was that?
No was there one?
Then there is more to do.
How is he now?
And what did you see?
But what will you do?
But WHAT DID you see?
Who will go first?
what has she to do with it?
But how about you?
And do you like him?
She has it.
But he had no time.
What can this be?
But how is that?
And when will you call?
Then, how do you know?
You can have some.
What can we do, then?
And what do you call her?
Did you know him?
Then make it up.
Are you there?
How can you know?
and so on, and so on.
And what do you make of it?
What would she have said?
He said no.
Did you see it?
And what did you do then?
Did you know her?
Can it be?
What was it?
Can one see from there?
What is he like?
What is it about?
Which is it?
So it was.
Would you like some?
How are you?
Is it like him?
So it was.
How long has he been there?
You can do it.
When was that?
Go on, he said.
Now you know.
How can you know?
There he is, do you see him?
Then who are you?
Who was he?
Then, how do you know?
And what did you do then?
but what if it is?
They said no more.
Did you know them?
When was it?
Can one see from there?

When is it?
What have you come for?
But how is that?

You have it.
Do as you will.
And what do you make of it?

Do you see him?
And when will you call?
He said no.
There they are.
But he had no time.

Call him in.
And has it come to this?
And who is this?
There you are.

You know how it is with her.
Who and what are you?

Then what is it?
But what is it?

What do you see?
Look at them.
