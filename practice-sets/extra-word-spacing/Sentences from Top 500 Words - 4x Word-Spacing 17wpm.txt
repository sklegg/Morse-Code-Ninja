Take good note of it.
This voice was that of my father.
Now we must wait.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
It was a very dark night.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Yes, my love?
He will sleep an hour.
Is he in bed?
Will you rest here a little?
He had, to be sure, done much.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Stay where you are.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Oh, all right.
Did he fall?
All that for nothing?
Who brought you up?
But it must be done soon.
It was a warm night.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Let him go free?
Lead me to him.
His will be done.
She heard and saw nothing.
Behind every book is a man.
Yes, very well.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Well, sit down.
Go back to bed.
Better sit still.
Oh, that.
Well, sit down by me.
We are free to act and think.
And yet you said he had money.
All right then, sit down.
Oh, this is too much.
Clear my name.
It was a record run.
Oh, take those off.
That would be a fine thing.
Let her wait.
This made him wonder more and more.
It has to be done.
It was right in front of us.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Half the town was there.
But let us see your plan.
Yes, we know that.
Here is our plan.
It was done.
What is done is done.
Yes, he said.
What a game.
Is that possible?
You brought no one with you?
Have you told them to bring the horse?
We are more strong together.
Then lead the way.
Oh, to be sure.
How was that possible?
Why, of course.
Go in there and drive them out.
All was dark.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
But what then must be done?
It was so very long ago.
It stood behind the door.
Very well, wait a minute.
His first cry was for his father.
Oh, do the best you can.
He has a good voice still.
Bring this with you.
She began to cry.
It was a kind of language between us.
They need a rest.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
She got her hand free.
Nothing at all.
Leave the rest to me.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Fine, very fine.
What has brought you here?
It was so long ago.
You are free to do so.
You will fall.
Sit down, said the old man.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
The old man gave no answer.
It was brought to me.
Of course it might.
Clear the way.
Let us sit down.
Free to do what?
The city was soon behind me.
Oh, very well, he said.
There is your old bed.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Answer me that, miss.
And then the game began all over again.
Come quick.
Be quick, for the time is short.
There was more to be done.
It is very clear.
Do you see that island?
You could see there was a story behind it.
They would cry.
And what have you done to me?
Well then, be quick.
Why did you bring him here?
Are they on foot?
Yes, she was back.
But how long ago?
Hold on a minute.
Is my father in town?
Did it all rest on me?
Nothing could have been better.
This is a test.
Oh, tell me.
Oh, he is so kind.
Well, of course.
He ran up to them.
What have you done?
Oh, of course.
Yes, go and find out.
Of course it is.
Yes, once.
He began to laugh.
Wait a minute.
It was very dark.
It is all done.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
You knew it, and said nothing?
Yes, to be sure.
Behind my bed.
Yes, it did.
He knew nothing.
Yes, he did.
Clear the table.
All of this was possible.
What brought you here?
See what you have done.
Nothing new under the sun.
What age is he?
You can sleep here.
Perhaps he did.
He gave me this paper.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Wait for me.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Oh, that is very simple.
Is it possible?
They know nothing about it.
Laugh, if you will.
Never mind how he came here.
He had made up his mind.
You love a certain person.
If only they would be quick.
Yes, it is true.
It is his voice.
What more is to be done?
Oh, nothing.
I hear his voice in the house.
Did she stay long?
Yes, what is it?
You can hear that, miss?
His plan is very simple.
And here is the note.
Her voice was low.
Then all was dark again.
He was here a minute ago.
But that is nothing to us.
It is no use, said a voice.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Are you strong?
Oh let me in.
Is that a fact?
Oh, man.
It is time for bed.
Money is power.
And what a voice she has.
What kind of voice is it?
You know nothing about it.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
He must be in the same boat as us.
How is that done?
Oh, do as you like.
He stood up.
and so he decide he go back home.
It must be done.
Well, there he stood.
Yes, and no.
Which box do you mean?
Oh, take me with you.
And he told you nothing?
Wait a second.
Bring it here.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Help me sit up.
Oh, go on.
Be back in a minute.
Just go to sleep.
Yes, she said.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Fly, my friend.
And you can do nothing until then?
Come back to us as soon as possible.
There, by the wheel.
He is in the box.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Wonder is it like that.
The night was dark.
You must have a rest.
Look at that dark water.
Do you talk in your sleep?
She could think of nothing more to say.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Oh, dont ask me.
Well, what about my plan?
The island was a mile long.
Oh, no.
Yes, go on.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Yes, sit down.
A fine thing too.
It was a cold, dark night.
We brought them in.
People might know my voice and find me out.
That is a fact.
What can be done?
He saw nothing.
Yes, but what did she say?
Never mind me.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
It was full of people.
But she is nothing to me now.
We must be quick.
The night was very dark.
Keep clear of him.
What has he done?
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Wonder what he does.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
There is no possible way.
Good to rest once in a way.
You know you must say yes.
Try to sleep.
That was well done.
Yes, all right.
Quick, friend, quick.
My mind is made up.
The whole day had been hot.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
It is nothing.
She gave me her hand.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
What have they done with my work?
But what must be done?
Play the game out.
Yes, that is true.
You must stay with me.
He never said nothing.
Go and rest.
What did the letter contain?
Yes, you are right.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Oh, if men only knew.
She was still game.
Dont laugh.
In a minute.
How can a little dog laugh?
Sit down, he said.
It was a dark night.
How long ago?
And yet you are the better off?
Bring them here.
Oh, you are there.
But never mind that.
In that town there is a street.
Get to bed.
It is done.
He must wait.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Where can you wait for me?
Oh, but you were there?
You must stay.
My mind was soon made up.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Wait and see.
They call him a fine boy.
And sit in the dark?
But they could see nothing.
Nothing could be more simple.
Yes, she could sing that.
Can it be possible?
Of course they will.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
He left long ago.
You are in my power.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Again came the voice.
At his side was a large green box.
Money is no object?
Come, and we can rest together.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Nothing had come of it.
It was hot.
It is a real bed.
Yes, of course.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Decide if you are going back home.
Do you have my note?
Yes, said the old man.
The snow is deep.
Nothing is more simple.
Oh, just listen.
It was cold and dark.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
There is nothing more to be said.
It is certain.
How was it done?
Just let us go free.
It must be done at once.
It might have done me good.
How long would you keep me in town?
Let me see your plan.
Oh, do you know?
You better stay here all night.
Nothing she can eat?
Like these in shape and size?
What have they done?
is it come yet?
Yes, there it is.
No, nothing of the kind.
Never mind that.
There is a lot of people.
Oh, come now.
That is possible.
Of course she will.
Wonder if he has a name.
Then he must be a wonder.
Yes, he said, all of it.
The water ran dry.
Well yes, you are right.
Did she fall?
No, nothing at all.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
But wait a minute.
It is possible.
Then it is certain?
Wait for me here, all of you.
Who gave it to you?
Well, miss?
Yes and no.
He is among us.
What is power?
Is it certain?
Of course he was right.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Why should my father fly?
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
The whole night the tree stood still.
They all fall to the ground.
