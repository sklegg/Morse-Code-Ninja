This is simple.
Before you leave, tell us.
Pull together.
You are a good girl.
He is better than any of you.
How many children did he leave?
what could be better?
Never heard of it.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Half a mile?
Can it be true?
He had my love.
That must be true.
Listen to them, he said.
Had you heard?
He put his hand over part of the map.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
In an hour it will be at the door.
We dont know enough.
who told you you could?
It was a round table.
They left in the morning.
He said, the work is now complete.
About the usual time.
She had very little notice from him.
From then on it was war between them.
Answer me this one question.
Are you ready?
We had better go in.
An example would be better.
Better cross here.
Let us leave them, she said.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
How do you feel?
Do you know that old lay?
Are you in love with her?
Did you get any money?
We serve them.
And what does she want the money for?
I have no children to love me.
Against what side?
Listen to him.
Does he love you?
He will leave me.
What will happen now?
Leave any for him?
That is enough for me.
It was cold.
Is the wind north or south?
But why must you leave me so soon?
Much of it was true.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
How does this happen?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Let us pass.
Why talk to me?
You must travel.
Take a hold of it.
How soon will he be here?
And serve them right.
Are they made to order?
He never heard.
You may go, said the King.
Now, listen.
An hour and a half.
They had heard all that before.
So we came down this road.
He is very simple.
The world is big enough.
In an hour?
What can happen?
Pass this way, then.
Then you will know me better.
It is cold.
That would be the best way.
She knew what was good for children.
It is the rule.
Do you love me?
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Take notice.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Have you heard from him often?
Let this man pass.
Well, young man?
How could that happen?
What have you against me now?
You may leave the room.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
you must step out.
Do you remember him?
Is that true?
Long and the short of it.
It was true.
Has she any family?
The dog is always with him.
Are you still cold?
Five young children.
You are right, young man.
And you are still so young.
Are we ready?
And how did he make his money?
Try it on the dog first.
Put down three and carry five.
Have you heard?
But she is very young.
To know her is to love her.
When did this happen?
We got her half way.
They are still young.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
It is a fire.
Hold it up to the light.
It is a young girl.
But listen to me.
The night was cold.
It would be better if you went to the war.
How short his time.
He never told us what it was she said.
Look to the west.
You have an hour.
Listen to me.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
And then he told all he knew.
She must be told.
You are better than that.
Leave off that.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
What is love?
What does he feel?
Can you sing?
You must leave that to me.
And you can sing?
You know me well enough.
A better man than you.
Pull it more to your side.
So the question was, what to do?
But enough of this.
It can never happen.
But let that pass.
Are you all ready?
Ten will be early enough.
How did this happen?
Are you ready to play?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Have you told her?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
We must make the best of it.
The King Went to him.
Then get ready at once.
No, my love.
You can pass through the door.
The rock was very small.
They had much to talk about.
It will interest you, said he.
Never heard of him.
Better late than never.
And dont talk to me.
In short, take me.
But one day you must feel it.
He has money.
Now listen to me.
Let us talk about you.
No, he is a man about my size.
She is much better.
It was all she could do to hold in.
Can she sing?
Hold her hand.
They knew it.
Is your family well?
Well, are you ready?
Then what would happen?
Ten, did you say?
Read them, said the King.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
What kind of a bird?
Where are you off to so early?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
She told me to ask you.
They can have all our half of the house.
Listen to this, will you?
Every word you said was heard.
When do you leave?
You were told.
This was true.
Take good care of the little girl.
It is a rock.
How does it feel?
And that is the whole point.
Let me remember what he said.
So do you, my love.
It would have been more simple.
What a state he was in.
She was so young, too.
The night was cold and still.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
The family was at home.
What will happen to us?
That is true.
Feel better then.
Fire and water, earth and air.
Long live the king.
Why do we love?
Who was it told me his name?
Little girl, where have you been?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Why do they want to make her sing?
She was a good girl.
Why did it happen?
Will you answer that question?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Half as many is too much.
If you know it, that is enough.
Have you a family?
you know better than that.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
She is fast?
That is enough.
Let that pass.
Is it true?
He had enough of it.
She was only a little girl.
But how simple it is.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Did they ever go back?
Which king?
That may be true.
Is your man white or black?
She told me all about it.
Do you remember?
You remember the place, my father?
He said, get him out of the road.
Let us talk a little about my father.
This will pass in no time.
We were up early.
A young man?
And so they began to talk.
And will you direct us?
Why do you serve?
That was the rule, she said.
And you will always love him?
You will always love him?
You saw the person?
What is there to talk about?
Light my fire.
There was no wind.
Did he though?
You love him?
Ask them to sing one more song.
You are right, my love.
Do you love her much?
you should know her better than me.
You are cold.
Who told you so?
Was he young or old?
Let me also ask you a question.
You had better go.
What a question.
He knew them.
If you only knew.
It was true to life.
They all heard me.
That is very simple.
And so they knew that it was true.
You are in love with me?
Young man, you will go far.
Had they been heard?
What have you heard?
Where did they get the money from?
This money was for her.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Do you remember me?
Your true father?
Made me feel so young.
Never heard of it before.
What do you mean by that question?
What size do you want?
A house is on fire?
How do you feel now?
As soon as you left, it began.
But listen to this, he said.
Leave me out of the question.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Let me see him, said the young man.
We knew them both.
Remember that time?
And why do you serve?
We will talk about that.
We are ready.
They told me to.
Let me hear from you soon.
No more money?
Does she go fast?
She is the first person in this house.
This is my body.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Are you better?
She knew at once.
Are you here on leave?
It is true.
You will soon know.
Do you want any money?
Your watch is slow.
Keep in step.
She is very plain.
You are on a ship?
Where he was, no one knew.
That was the question.
On fire, on fire.
We had a list.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
We call it black.
Do you own a dog?
It has been there ever since.
Better write it here.
But he never heard me.
But what did we ever get for it?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
One other question, said he.
He got it this morning.
No less, no more.
Who told you that?
Did you tell him your whole story?
They had several children.
How far from the body?
There are four hundred?
