Give me your hand.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
What on earth does this mean?
No, tell me.
It would be very kind of you.
How did you get me out?
She has been with him many long years.
What did he say?
Here it is, he said.
Then what kind is it?
What was it you said to me?
But he does so need a mother.
He has more to give.
He will live.
Come with me.
Good day, one and all.
Give it to me, then.
What more could a man ask for?
You are right.
Go and try.
Is it you or me?
That is right.
In what year?
It will take a little time.
If you want to know, go and find out.
Do you think so now?
All right, then.
Some day you may ask me about it.
Where does he live?
Why are you here?
Well, how are you?
What does all this mean?
We will say no more about it, then.
Much good that would be.
What did you say your name was?
That is all one can say about her.
Only two there now.
This for me?
See, they are here.
Get to work.
Good day to you.
What do you mean by that?
That is the end of her.
And what did she say?
What on earth do you mean?
Is it all right?
And how in the world did you find them?
And do you know why?
Well, go on.
And what is her name?
Can you point it out to me?
What does he mean?
What could set you off in the first place?
And how did you find out?
What a good thing it would be.
Where are you from?
He was at work again.
You are most kind.
And what did he say?
What is that in your hand?
Say what you want.
Give him air.
How much do you want?
Why is he here?
But who was your mother?
What is his name?
Now, go home.
Tell me his name.
They are here.
That was a house to look at.
Is he big?
Where are we to turn for help?
It is the same thing.
What does she want?
Read that, she said.
That is just my point.
There will just be time.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
What do you think of that?
Good, he said.
She was the cause of it all.
Come with me to the little house.
Then will come our time.
Do you think so?
Put it on.
Just like me.
There is the little boy.
And why is that?
But why do you ask me?
That would be very good.
And where is he now?
Is there no one who can help me?
Think of him.
Say no more.
She came up to them.
You must tell me.
I would like to see her again in that.
Where do they get that?
That was very good.
And how old were you at that time?
She went on.
There, that does me good.
It is very kind of you.
Where are we?
Where did he come from?
Now, you know me.
Is he a good man?
Where did you place it?
Well, how did it go?
Show it to me.
Then they will follow you?
Are they like each other?
What do you play?
Well, read it.
It is great.
For some man.
Is that right?
Are you back again?
Think no more about that.
Where to, now?
How do you take it?
You think so, too?
Where are you?
What do you want to ask these people?
Here is the way we put in the time.
What do you think of her?
Well, all right.
Why, what do you mean?
You think so?
What will each of you give?
How does he use it?
Will you try?
He went to him.
How can you find out?
Who is that man?
And what will they do with us?
What do they want?
Where have you been?
Why are they here?
What does one live for?
Large or small?
Where is he now?
They had all been very good to us.
And where is it?
Now we see the light.
You can help me here.
How did you get here?
Where in the world did you come from?
You were near him.
When will it take place?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
When will her mother come?
What could she mean by it?
We are who we say we are.
Well, and is that all?
Play with them.
And a very good thing, too.
Is it as good now?
Why, what is it, then?
That was a good time.
Well then, tell him so.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
What did he tell you?
He said that that would help.
And what do you think?
In what part of the house?
It must be where you put it.
And it did me good.
Now come here.
We are here.
She has a house?
Do it for me.
That is right, said the old man.
But where is it?
What do you think of him?
Now, what do you want with me?
Get out of the way.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Well, tell me.
Is this the man?
What would you have me do?
They want more.
Ask her, he said.
What you have just said is good, very good.
Call me what you will, he said.
Do you know me?
Where is she?
It was high time.
Give me more than that
Where have they been?
Try it on.
Turn this way.
Well, here he is.
There is no place like home.
Why are you like this?
What do they say was the cause?
But it is just so with the world.
Think what you will.
Show me the way he went.
You can say what it is.
How could she say such a thing.
Can you take me?
Will you come with me?
All in good time.
This is the first act.
Is that all you want?
And in she went.
He said too much.
this one, too?
What do you want me to do?
Give me my work.
What did you say that for?
You will get on in the world.
Where are you off to?
What was his name?
How much are they?
How long have you been here?
Just look through it.
How on earth do you know?
How does she use you?
Is there some for me?
do you come from the end of the world?
When will he come back?
There is no one here to see.
Are you here for good?
After three, he said.
Been back long?
How can you tell?
Can you help me find my way?
Just look at her.
But why do you ask?
How can you think of such a thing?
How old was she?
How old are you?
Take some, she said.
To what end?
You must come now.
For how much?
where did she come from?
Have you been here long?
She had to tell him.
Tell me who made the world.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Why did he come?
Now tell me.
This is the man.
You know, you see right through people.
Do you want me to do it?
Who will tell her?
Hand it in.
Would you now like to look round my place?
Time to get out.
Is she well?
Give me a light.
Move on, then.
And who is the man?
Tell us all about it.
Here she is.
Ask him to show up?
You are a good boy.
Well, and what do you think?
Who are these men?
Which house is it?
There she is again.
Three, he said.
He was so kind.
She was right.
take them all.
And they went home.
But you must.
Follow me, said the man.
It is all the same.
Well, did he?
Too much of this.
This is my point.
No, mother.
Come with me, then.
One, two, three.
Very well then.
Tell me all about it.
Well, what do you think about it?
You are all very kind to me.
What does she think about me?
Will you take me to her?
But what does it mean?
And what are they made of?
Where is he?
See, here it is.
Too much in the way.
We must come back.
Do you think she was?
It is very high.
The world is before you.
What do you mean?
At your house?
Show me the way.
Read that, he said.
He was there too.
Show us where you live, said the man.
Now where did they come from?
And where is this man?
Why do you want to know?
Look at me.
But where are we to go?
And where is she, then?
And where was the place?
But where is he?
What have you been after?
And have you been here long?
But what about me?
There is more to tell.
Give it me.
Get out and play.
Say no more about it.
And off we go.
What is your name?
Is it any good?
But he is right.
Think it over.
Well then, what do you want?
Why do you want water?
there are only two.
Look at it other way round.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
He will ask for it.
Why is that?
How did that help you?
But this is the point.
Are you at it again?
Very well, he said.
He was here.
Very well, show him to me.
He is at my house.
Such as what?
Well, what do you think?
Is it large?
What will you say?
Too much for me now.
And that was the end of it.
And what about your mother?
Tell me about it.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Now it was time to act.
Where could he be?
There was work to do.
Take this and this.
How can you say that?
What do you want?
What is in your hand?
Here it is.
What does it all mean?
Come and help me.
Where do you live?
Tell us your name.
And what was his name?
You must take me with you.
Where are they off to now?
Then why are you here?
You see it every day.
Here is my hand.
He went on his way.
The first act was over.
There was no one near.
Did you tell him?
What do you think of this?
But what did you want?
Were you here before me?
