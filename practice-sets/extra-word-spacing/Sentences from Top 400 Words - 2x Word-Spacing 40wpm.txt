Let me see him, said the young man.
What size do you want?
But she is very young.
We will talk about that.
Can you sing?
An hour and a half.
If you only knew.
No more money?
The world is big enough.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
No, my love.
She knew what was good for children.
Are you ready to play?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
You are better than that.
Look to the west.
As soon as you left, it began.
And so they knew that it was true.
Are you all ready?
They knew it.
He is very simple.
Did you tell him your whole story?
It would have been more simple.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
This was true.
Let this man pass.
That is enough.
You are in love with me?
Do you remember?
Now, listen.
Who told you so?
Your true father?
They can have all our half of the house.
Are you better?
Leave me out of the question.
What will happen to us?
you should know her better than me.
That would be the best way.
The King Went to him.
Pull it more to your side.
Why talk to me?
Well, young man?
And you are still so young.
Are you in love with her?
Read them, said the King.
Let me also ask you a question.
What a question.
An example would be better.
Light my fire.
Better cross here.
He said, the work is now complete.
what could be better?
What a state he was in.
Are you ready?
If you know it, that is enough.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
We are ready.
We must make the best of it.
You may go, said the King.
They had several children.
Before you leave, tell us.
He got it this morning.
This is simple.
The family was at home.
He had enough of it.
Is it true?
That may be true.
He put his hand over part of the map.
You love him?
What is there to talk about?
We serve them.
But listen to me.
And how did he make his money?
It would be better if you went to the war.
Did you get any money?
Half as many is too much.
We got her half way.
It was true.
Listen to this, will you?
He said, get him out of the road.
Hold it up to the light.
Why did it happen?
You remember the place, my father?
You are right, young man.
Let us talk about you.
you must step out.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
It was true to life.
I have no children to love me.
That is true.
Listen to me.
Your watch is slow.
You can pass through the door.
Is your family well?
Try it on the dog first.
It has been there ever since.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Five young children.
Listen to him.
How far from the body?
She must be told.
That must be true.
Do you love her much?
It was cold.
And dont talk to me.
You will always love him?
Who was it told me his name?
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
You saw the person?
Where did they get the money from?
The night was cold and still.
This will pass in no time.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
So the question was, what to do?
What can happen?
Are you here on leave?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
It is a fire.
Ask them to sing one more song.
Take notice.
Was he young or old?
He never heard.
And why do you serve?
He had my love.
Let me hear from you soon.
How short his time.
You are cold.
What have you heard?
Let that pass.
It is the rule.
But he never heard me.
We had a list.
Do you want any money?
We call it black.
Every word you said was heard.
The rock was very small.
Can it be true?
And serve them right.
Had they been heard?
But listen to this, he said.
She had very little notice from him.
Put down three and carry five.
Hold her hand.
She was only a little girl.
Why do they want to make her sing?
Will you answer that question?
But let that pass.
They are still young.
We knew them both.
What do you mean by that question?
And so they began to talk.
It was all she could do to hold in.
Let us pass.
He has money.
Where he was, no one knew.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
This is my body.
Did they ever go back?
Have you heard?
In an hour it will be at the door.
Then get ready at once.
How do you feel?
They told me to.
Who told you that?
You were told.
They had much to talk about.
Are we ready?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
What does he feel?
But why must you leave me so soon?
In an hour?
Ten will be early enough.
Is that true?
That was the question.
Does she go fast?
Had you heard?
Can she sing?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
What will happen now?
From then on it was war between them.
who told you you could?
Is your man white or black?
You will soon know.
Against what side?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Feel better then.
What kind of a bird?
How does it feel?
You must travel.
We were up early.
Fire and water, earth and air.
And you can sing?
When did this happen?
Which king?
Now listen to me.
What is love?
Pull together.
Well, are you ready?
One other question, said he.
Keep in step.
Better late than never.
This money was for her.
What have you against me now?
How do you feel now?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
You had better go.
There was no wind.
Never heard of it.
It is true.
She is fast?
She is much better.
They had heard all that before.
That is enough for me.
Leave any for him?
Leave off that.
Never heard of it before.
He is better than any of you.
Take good care of the little girl.
To know her is to love her.
In short, take me.
Listen to them, he said.
How did this happen?
Is the wind north or south?
Do you remember me?
You are right, my love.
Do you know that old lay?
We dont know enough.
No less, no more.
And you will always love him?
Let us talk a little about my father.
Much of it was true.
Let us leave them, she said.
you know better than that.
When do you leave?
But what did we ever get for it?
She knew at once.
And then he told all he knew.
She is very plain.
Young man, you will go far.
It will interest you, said he.
How soon will he be here?
You have an hour.
Let me remember what he said.
Where are you off to so early?
That is very simple.
Remember that time?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
She was a good girl.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
It is cold.
She is the first person in this house.
Are they made to order?
She told me to ask you.
Why do we love?
It was a round table.
She told me all about it.
And will you direct us?
A house is on fire?
Does he love you?
Why do you serve?
Do you own a dog?
You may leave the room.
Half a mile?
So do you, my love.
Take a hold of it.
A young man?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
She was so young, too.
It can never happen.
But how simple it is.
You are a good girl.
Little girl, where have you been?
How many children did he leave?
You must leave that to me.
And that is the whole point.
Long live the king.
About the usual time.
It is a rock.
On fire, on fire.
There are four hundred?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
Long and the short of it.
They left in the morning.
Did he though?
You have your whole life before you, she said.
How could that happen?
Have you heard from him often?
Are you still cold?
It is a young girl.
No, he is a man about my size.
Do you love me?
He never told us what it was she said.
And what does she want the money for?
But one day you must feel it.
He will leave me.
Never heard of him.
Made me feel so young.
You are on a ship?
The dog is always with him.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
The night was cold.
Has she any family?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
He knew them.
Do you remember him?
Then you will know me better.
That was the rule, she said.
Ten, did you say?
A better man than you.
Have you told her?
We took our leave early, and left together.
Then what would happen?
We had better go in.
So we came down this road.
You know me well enough.
How does this happen?
Pass this way, then.
Have you a family?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Better write it here.
They all heard me.
Answer me this one question.
But enough of this.
