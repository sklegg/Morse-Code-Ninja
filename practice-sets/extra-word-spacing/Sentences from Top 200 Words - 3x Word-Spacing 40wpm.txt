Give it to me, then.
Good day to you.
What was his name?
When will it take place?
Turn this way.
Here it is, he said.
That was very good.
Will you try?
Give me a light.
But he is right.
Show me the way.
We must come back.
Why did he come?
And where is she, then?
Good, he said.
It is very high.
Just like me.
Is it you or me?
How old was she?
Think what you will.
You think so?
Take this and this.
Then what kind is it?
Where have they been?
Tell me his name.
Is it large?
Do you think she was?
How did you get me out?
All in good time.
In what part of the house?
But this is the point.
You must tell me.
What did you say your name was?
And what did she say?
Here is the way we put in the time.
What more could a man ask for?
It must be where you put it.
Where do you live?
Are you at it again?
This is the man.
When will her mother come?
What do you mean?
What do they want?
Why are you here?
She was right.
Say what you want.
This is the first act.
Now, go home.
It was high time.
You are a good boy.
Can you help me find my way?
Now it was time to act.
Are you here for good?
Take some, she said.
Why, what is it, then?
There she is again.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
There is more to tell.
Ask him to show up?
And what will they do with us?
And they went home.
There is no place like home.
What do you mean by that?
Look at it other way round.
Think of him.
Good day, one and all.
She has been with him many long years.
Follow me, said the man.
Do you know me?
What does all this mean?
But what about me?
Well, go on.
But where is it?
How much are they?
And what about your mother?
take them all.
There was no one near.
Can you take me?
How can you find out?
Why do you want to know?
That is right.
Here it is.
And it did me good.
But why do you ask me?
Who are these men?
For how much?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
What is in your hand?
She was the cause of it all.
Is it all right?
And who is the man?
Tell us all about it.
Read that, she said.
You see it every day.
Now where did they come from?
Where are you?
Where does he live?
It is the same thing.
You can help me here.
All right, then.
Here she is.
Where could he be?
Hand it in.
Well, did he?
That is just my point.
Only two there now.
Play with them.
Call me what you will, he said.
Very well, he said.
But what does it mean?
She has a house?
The first act was over.
Well then, what do you want?
do you come from the end of the world?
Where do they get that?
For some man.
No, mother.
Will you come with me?
It is great.
It is very kind of you.
What does she want?
Where have you been?
But you must.
Then why are you here?
To what end?
What on earth do you mean?
That would be very good.
They are here.
He went to him.
How does she use you?
And how did you find out?
Been back long?
Give me more than that
Who is that man?
He was at work again.
And why is that?
He is at my house.
We are who we say we are.
And off we go.
There is no one here to see.
How did you get here?
Where are we to turn for help?
What a good thing it would be.
Try it on.
Is it any good?
Too much in the way.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Where are you from?
Where are they off to now?
What do you think of that?
Show us where you live, said the man.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
What does he mean?
And how in the world did you find them?
Here is my hand.
How can you tell?
How old are you?
Have you been here long?
In what year?
Well, and is that all?
Is there some for me?
What you have just said is good, very good.
But who was your mother?
Get out of the way.
where did she come from?
This for me?
He was there too.
What was it you said to me?
Where did you place it?
Give it me.
How did that help you?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Show me the way he went.
Much good that would be.
Is it as good now?
How long have you been here?
And what did he say?
Did you tell him?
But what did you want?
She came up to them.
Very well then.
How much do you want?
Where is she?
What will each of you give?
There, that does me good.
Come and help me.
Which house is it?
The world is before you.
Tell us your name.
He said that that would help.
It would be very kind of you.
You can say what it is.
Where did he come from?
You will get on in the world.
Well, and what do you think?
Well, what do you think?
One, two, three.
Well, read it.
Where are we?
Then they will follow you?
Think no more about that.
You were near him.
Some day you may ask me about it.
Where is he?
That was a good time.
Why are they here?
What is that in your hand?
What did he say?
Look at me.
How on earth do you know?
What on earth does this mean?
That was a house to look at.
Why are you like this?
Such as what?
Is this the man?
She had to tell him.
Now we see the light.
Then will come our time.
And what are they made of?
How does he use it?
And do you know why?
That is all one can say about her.
I would like to see her again in that.
What did he tell you?
And where was the place?
But where are we to go?
How can you say that?
Ask her, he said.
You must take me with you.
If you want to know, go and find out.
What do you think of him?
What will you say?
Come with me to the little house.
And what was his name?
At your house?
What do you think of this?
Do it for me.
Think it over.
Say no more.
She went on.
Just look at her.
It will take a little time.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Where are you off to?
Where in the world did you come from?
Now tell me.
Get to work.
Do you want me to do it?
And what is her name?
Read that, he said.
Well, how did it go?
Will you take me to her?
there are only two.
What did you say that for?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
When will he come back?
Is she well?
What do you want me to do?
Why do you want water?
Put it on.
Well then, tell him so.
This is my point.
Would you now like to look round my place?
Do you think so?
After three, he said.
Well, here he is.
Now, what do you want with me?
That is right, said the old man.
What does one live for?
And have you been here long?
But he does so need a mother.
Very well, show him to me.
He will ask for it.
They want more.
How do you take it?
Move on, then.
Can you point it out to me?
Who will tell her?
He has more to give.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
There will just be time.
What do you play?
We are here.
And that was the end of it.
There was work to do.
And where is this man?
Just look through it.
What have you been after?
Too much for me now.
Are you back again?
Is that all you want?
He said too much.
Why is that?
Come with me.
He went on his way.
We will say no more about it, then.
But why do you ask?
But where is he?
Why, what do you mean?
You think so, too?
Tell me who made the world.
What do you want to ask these people?
And how old were you at that time?
Is that right?
There is the little boy.
What is his name?
Well, what do you think about it?
Tell me all about it.
But it is just so with the world.
Where is he now?
What do you want?
Well, all right.
He will live.
You are most kind.
He was so kind.
Come with me, then.
And what do you think?
Get out and play.
Give him air.
They had all been very good to us.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Well, how are you?
Give me your hand.
What could she mean by it?
Well, tell me.
See, here it is.
Where to, now?
Do you think so now?
What is your name?
Is he a good man?
And in she went.
Large or small?
You are right.
And where is it?
Say no more about it.
Too much of this.
What does she think about me?
And where is he now?
Were you here before me?
How can you think of such a thing?
And a very good thing, too.
Now come here.
Are they like each other?
No, tell me.
Why is he here?
What could set you off in the first place?
Time to get out.
Give me my work.
Go and try.
How could she say such a thing.
See, they are here.
Three, he said.
What would you have me do?
Is he big?
That is the end of her.
He was here.
What do they say was the cause?
You know, you see right through people.
this one, too?
You must come now.
You are all very kind to me.
Tell me about it.
Is there no one who can help me?
What do you think of her?
What does it all mean?
Now, you know me.
Show it to me.
It is all the same.
