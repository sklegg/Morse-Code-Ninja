And where is this man?
Tell me all about it.
But you must.
What a good thing it would be.
Give it me.
In what year?
Where does he live?
Well, here he is.
Then they will follow you?
What do you want to ask these people?
What did he tell you?
Do you know me?
Get out and play.
Put it on.
Think of him.
Is there no one who can help me?
Very well, show him to me.
He went on his way.
You think so?
How can you find out?
That is right, said the old man.
They had all been very good to us.
There was no one near.
And have you been here long?
Now, what do you want with me?
Try it on.
What did you say your name was?
Say what you want.
How did you get me out?
And do you know why?
Who is that man?
Why are you like this?
How did you get here?
Were you here before me?
Too much for me now.
What could set you off in the first place?
You were near him.
There is no place like home.
Where did he come from?
The first act was over.
Good, he said.
Why, what do you mean?
He said that that would help.
That was very good.
Is it large?
Well then, what do you want?
Are you here for good?
There, that does me good.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Where do they get that?
Where are we?
Think it over.
She has a house?
She was the cause of it all.
Is that right?
It is all the same.
Now it was time to act.
What was it you said to me?
This is the first act.
Hand it in.
Read that, he said.
And where was the place?
Good day, one and all.
You think so, too?
This is the man.
He will live.
What do you mean by that?
Do it for me.
And what is her name?
Follow me, said the man.
In what part of the house?
There she is again.
Well, what do you think?
Give it to me, then.
How old was she?
But it is just so with the world.
All in good time.
Tell me his name.
Well, what do you think about it?
For some man.
No, mother.
He went to him.
What do you want?
What does it all mean?
Why, what is it, then?
That is all one can say about her.
He said too much.
That was a house to look at.
Well, how are you?
It was high time.
Well, how did it go?
Where are we to turn for help?
Turn this way.
How on earth do you know?
We must come back.
See, they are here.
Well then, tell him so.
And what was his name?
But what did you want?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
And where is it?
We are who we say we are.
It will take a little time.
What does he mean?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Well, read it.
Which house is it?
He is at my house.
Well, did he?
Give me your hand.
It is very high.
Well, go on.
Now come here.
And off we go.
Come with me, then.
You know, you see right through people.
Do you think so?
Give me my work.
Here is my hand.
Here it is.
What do you think of him?
How did that help you?
Is there some for me?
Look at it other way round.
Say no more.
You must take me with you.
Get to work.
Where is he now?
Where in the world did you come from?
Take this and this.
Why do you want water?
What did you say that for?
What you have just said is good, very good.
All right, then.
Then will come our time.
Come with me to the little house.
And what did she say?
Do you want me to do it?
Are you at it again?
Look at me.
They are here.
Good day to you.
Give me a light.
Where have they been?
But why do you ask me?
Where are they off to now?
You are a good boy.
Now, go home.
You can help me here.
What is in your hand?
Where did you place it?
Well, and what do you think?
Show it to me.
And how old were you at that time?
Here it is, he said.
What does she think about me?
How long have you been here?
Where do you live?
Will you take me to her?
It is very kind of you.
Tell me who made the world.
It must be where you put it.
And what do you think?
And in she went.
And that was the end of it.
Where have you been?
Well, tell me.
You are all very kind to me.
Large or small?
We will say no more about it, then.
there are only two.
Been back long?
He was here.
Would you now like to look round my place?
Just look at her.
How much do you want?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
What do you play?
do you come from the end of the world?
Why do you want to know?
Can you help me find my way?
How old are you?
What do they say was the cause?
He was at work again.
When will her mother come?
Why are you here?
And they went home.
What do they want?
That would be very good.
Tell me about it.
She went on.
There is no one here to see.
But what does it mean?
And what are they made of?
Are you back again?
Now tell me.
This for me?
It was now his turn to look about him.
And what will they do with us?
Can you take me?
Just like me.
What do you think of that?
At your house?
What do you think of this?
Why are they here?
We are here.
Is it any good?
Will you try?
What does one live for?
Say no more about it.
where did she come from?
What on earth does this mean?
That is just my point.
Where is she?
How can you think of such a thing?
Is he big?
And a very good thing, too.
She has been with him many long years.
Much good that would be.
He will ask for it.
Where could he be?
Read that, she said.
And how did you find out?
Tell us all about it.
Time to get out.
I would like to see her again in that.
Is it you or me?
Think what you will.
Is this the man?
For how much?
Will you come with me?
Where are you?
Too much of this.
Give me more than that
They want more.
Is it as good now?
When will he come back?
Is he a good man?
Go and try.
And where is he now?
But he is right.
What does all this mean?
Why is that?
But where is it?
To what end?
Are they like each other?
How much are they?
Now we see the light.
What is that in your hand?
You are right.
Call me what you will, he said.
What will you say?
But this is the point.
And where is she, then?
And why is that?
You are most kind.
He was so kind.
Very well, he said.
Some day you may ask me about it.
When will it take place?
Why did he come?
Then why are you here?
Have you been here long?
this one, too?
He was there too.
Show me the way he went.
Now, you know me.
What did he say?
There will just be time.
Where are you off to?
The world is before you.
One, two, three.
And what about your mother?
This is my point.
Now where did they come from?
And it did me good.
She had to tell him.
Why is he here?
That was a good time.
You see it every day.
It is great.
If you want to know, go and find out.
What could she mean by it?
That is right.
Well, all right.
You can say what it is.
It is the same thing.
Only two there now.
Who will tell her?
Three, he said.
Come and help me.
But where is he?
Did you tell him?
Do you think so now?
How can you say that?
What do you want me to do?
Where are you from?
How could she say such a thing.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
After three, he said.
You must tell me.
Ask her, he said.
You will get on in the world.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
What do you mean?
Take some, she said.
He has more to give.
Is that all you want?
You must come now.
It would be very kind of you.
What is his name?
How can you tell?
There was work to do.
Here she is.
What on earth do you mean?
But he does so need a mother.
But where are we to go?
Can you point it out to me?
Very well then.
But what about me?
Do you think she was?
Is it all right?
But why do you ask?
She came up to them.
Ask him to show up?
What was his name?
And how in the world did you find them?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
But who was your mother?
Play with them.
No, tell me.
Then what kind is it?
She was right.
Think no more about that.
Where is he?
Where to, now?
Come with me.
Such as what?
And what did he say?
Here is the way we put in the time.
And who is the man?
What does she want?
Show me the way.
How does she use you?
Get out of the way.
What is your name?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
What have you been after?
Tell us your name.
What would you have me do?
Just look through it.
take them all.
How do you take it?
Move on, then.
Well, and is that all?
Who are these men?
See, here it is.
What more could a man ask for?
What will each of you give?
That is the end of her.
There is the little boy.
Is she well?
There is more to tell.
What do you think of her?
Too much in the way.
Give him air.
How does he use it?
