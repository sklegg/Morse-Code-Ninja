And then we may begin.
Then let me have a word with you.
Do we stop here?
But they may still come here.
It will be too late.
Well, what next?
But it is all all too late now.
But take care.
What a night it has been.
Why is he cross with me?
We must go at once.
Tell us a story.
How would they stop it?
We got under way at last.
One was on a white horse.
When did you begin?
What was left of him?
Why, it was one of his own men.
Who can answer for that?
No, never.
There were few near me.
We may be too late.
You must never tell.
It is always so.
We are together.
This took him some time.
How many are left?
My father is right.
He has children of his own.
Do you know what he did last night?
But it was very late.
We might learn a thing or two.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Why should this be so?
Are you my friend?
But she saw no one?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Will you never learn?
Is my father here?
You are right, father.
You saw him?
But you got to play music for them.
He has been been found.
You have a car?
It was like new life to him.
One of us will be here all night.
Are we too late?
You are sure of that?
Let him answer us.
You took it.
We should ask him.
So they got out and went in.
But watch over him.
That is the idea.
Do you hear that?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
So he began to help.
Where has she run off to?
That was the first night.
Always the same, year after year.
Look at his face.
Good night again.
In the country?
He came at once.
Any book will tell you that.
Let me see him.
Never see him again.
And now, good night.
First turn to the left.
Here is the book.
He is my father.
Just cut it out, will you?
You must walk.
Have you never been there?
These were the first people we saw.
To the left.
Well, run back to her.
This is what began it all.
He may come close.
Open the door.
Let me say one thing.
And there are four of you?
Let me look.
They dont know their own country.
We got one and they got one.
Watch him, he said.
Then, good night.
He is at sea.
We are very far from that.
Why should they?
You must eat now.
Who said four?
The other night she left.
This is my country.
Here is the letter.
But now it is too late.
Can you hear me?
She might be at his house.
Take care of him.
Where have you been this long while?
What do you think of the music?
It was the first thing he thought of.
There are only four of us.
Why dont you play?
He had only one night more to live.
That night we were just in time.
At four, she said.
She saw no one?
Let me see him at once.
Stop, said he.
Music is a good thing.
How many children?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
And what did you learn from him?
Was you in my room?
Do you often come back?
Only, dont look back.
Do you want some more to eat?
Why, is it late?
And your children?
So it always was.
Is he a real father?
Dont say that to me.
You are sure of it?
Cut your hand open?
Let me get to work.
Keep watch all night.
Let me out.
Are you sure?
But what did you hear?
He said at last.
He saw his men draw back.
Do you have the letter?
They never come back.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
And this food?
But it is the same with any life.
So, once more, good night.
Let me be and let me live.
Tell her to begin.
They always know.
Write an answer.
Let me hear what it is.
Let us start, then.
Let him grow up with you.
She is my friend.
Let me get on with my work.
Do you hear me?
No, that can never be.
You might want it.
Have you got it?
We never thought of that.
Now or never.
They never did it again.
What a start that was.
The children will live just the same.
It is from your father.
He is my friend.
By and by he got it.
He might still be up.
Point it at his horse.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Let me know at once when you will start.
Let me see her.
He could run no more.
Let us go in.
And he left the room.
Are we late?
What is your real name?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
It was the last day of the year.
It is open?
There is only food for one.
Dont you see that?
Give me the letter.
Off with his head.
They are hard at it.
What do you think when you hear music?
Come over in the sun.
One never has too much.
It must be in her own house.
See him grow up.
We found it.
Call the next one.
Is it in the city?
Where is the river?
But you must never tell.
But it would be in the paper.
Keep to the right.
And she left the room.
He had two left feet.
What is life to you?
Here we see the boy at school.
But why dont you want to take it?
Let us cross over.
There to the left.
Well, read the letter again.
But hard to tell.
Dont you think so?
We were together.
Come let us see them.
This is real.
How could you let him go so far?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
For once you are right.
Take care.
Come, let us be men.
And who is this friend?
Right here it began.
Have you got that?
Watch over him.
Both of us.
Which end is his head?
They dont care.
There was no letter for me.
She must have a hard time with him.
Keep to the left.
Our own people must come first.
Does he never go out?
There, do you hear?
Come at once.
What did you hear?
Is that far?
He is always at it.
Have you been at sea?
Did you see his eye?
Ask one of those men.
And then they began to fish.
Who found them out?
You found him?
How could you begin?
Say good night.
It was his own room.
It was then time to start.
Do you want to cross?
Cut him down.
Why dont you want to go?
Dont tell me.
Let me go to the door.
What was the name of the man who took it?
And now let us go home.
Have you found it?
Let her go.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
They are always the same.
It is a long story.
it took all that time to come over the water.
She never came back.
Do you know how he made his mark?
Can you stand?
A second man got up and went out.
At this time of my life, no.
Just a few.
They came over last night.
We should look at this.
Let me in.
Where could you keep it?
They may tell us to open it.
You got me?
But let us walk.
How much have you got?
Do you have a car?
It is so very kind of you both.
He then said, It is time to start.
Why, dont you hear it?
Still, you never know.
Here is the paper.
what river is it?
What would you have me do with my life?
What was it that you thought?
One night more and he would be on his way.
Life is all right.
No, said the Tree.
No, said her father.
Who did you learn that from?
Who could have thought it?
Off with her head.
We got to let that go.
The sun had set long since.
Now let me have it.
No, stop.
There was no answer.
She came in just now by the back door.
Stop, let me show you the way.
A call for help, you thought?
It would seem so.
Always the same with you people.
Let me have a word with you.
You must study.
But are you sure of that?
At last we have a man.
Stop and think.
Here he is at last.
What did he say in the letter?
Let me go back.
You should take me there one day.
We must begin again.
What did he answer?
But then it will be too late.
What do you hear?
Who took him out of it?
Think of my father.
What country does he come from?
She saw it.
You will answer for it.
Let me hear your story.
Dont you want any?
Dont you like it?
Dont move, he said.
She came over last night.
But then you would be close to the sea?
She got up.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Is there any answer?
Few had found it.
Why do you stop here?
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Come eat with me.
Where is this city?
Good night, friend.
And what did you do with that letter?
Is it far?
Come here, my friend.
It might help.
Which story was it?
Let him follow me.
Who was the letter from?
Just cut it out.
It was very hard.
Let them have it.
No, dont.
It is music.
And why should they?
How did it begin?
Sure of what?
Go to your father.
Are you sure of it?
It was white.
Let us go back.
Do you know where he is?
Good for the country.
Let me see it.
What should he say?
Tell me more.
She is still here?
So take care of me.
Now you must eat.
Who should it be?
No, why should he?
Just set still and take it like a man.
Who let you in?
We dont see it like that.
It is well thought of.
