Do you know her?
Is that her?
You have them?
Will that do?
What do you make of that?
That will do, said he.
What DO you know of him?
You can have some.
It was from you.
Now is your time.
and so on, and so on.
And has it come to this?
Are you there?
How is he?
And do you like her?
Or so they said.
What did you do then?
What other way is there to look at it?
what is it?
What will you do, then?
What is that?
How did she do it?
Go on, he said.
Can you do that?
Do they know him?
Look at it.
How did you know about it?
That will do, he said.
but we can go and see.
Look at it this way.
We have no water.
May we come in?
But so it is.
Would you like some?
Then, how do you know?
There is but one thing to do.
Who was he?
What do you make of it?
There were two of them.
The time had come.
Come this way.
How can you know?
What did they do?
So be it.
Has it come to this?
He said no.
And who are you?
When was it?
but there was more to it than this.
How did he do it?
When is it?
How long has he been there?
But it was of no use.
And is that all?
Is he there?
How is she?
And how did you find out?
What would she have said?
Which is it?
What is it about?
What is it all about?
And what was it for?
When was that?
No was there one?
Who and what are you?
Then make it up.
There you are, he said.
That is a long time.
Then how many are there?
But how about you?
Then what are you up to now?
What did he do to you?
How was that?
Now what are we to do with you?
And what is that?
You can go.
Then there is more to do.
No one will come, she said.
But what is it?
What are we to do?
Do you know what it is?
what has she to do with it?
What can this be?
Did you know them?
What is there to see?
There they are.
Is it time?
How do you do?
Is she like him?
What is all this?
But what are you up to?
What was it?
What was it about?
How would you like to have it?
What was he like?
Who will go first?
There he is, she said.
She has it.
but what if it is?
So that was the way.
One or two?
So it is.
Do you know?
Do you see it?
Did you know him?
And all for what?
who can it be?
What have you come for?
You can do it.
There he is, do you see him?
What can we do, then?
But will he see it?
That was it.
We have him.
Out of the way.
Is it like him?
At what time?
You may go.
Who is she?
And what did you do then?
Do you see him?
But it has been so long.
What do you see?
What do they call you?
Then what is it?
And what do you call her?
Did you know her?
are you there?
But how is that?
What is it for?
So there it was.
Look at him.
Would you do what he did?
You know how it is with her.
Do you know what you look like?
How is he now?
Tqhen you may go.
And who is this?
Who was that?
And could she see him?
But he had no time.
What time is it?
What is it like?
who, then, are you?
And who was that?
How did you come by it?
You have it.
Do you like him?
Is that all?
What could it be?
Call him in.
But WHAT DID you see?
And what do you make of it?
Can one see from there?
Is that it?
What are you up to?
At what number?
Will you come and see her?
Then who are you?
They said no more.
So it was.
But he had to have it.
And what did you see?
The time will come.
And when will you call?
There he is, you see.
How are you?
And do you like him?
You know more than we do.
Did you see it?
Now you know.
Had to look the other way.
Do you know him?
Now there is no more to be said.
How can it be?
There you are.
But what have they been up to?
That was all she said.
But who was she?
But what will you do?
That is what she did.
Do as you like.
Can it be?
Look at them.
What is he like?
Is it over?
But when will that be?
Look over it.
Who are you?
Do as you will.
Did you see her?
At what number?
May we come in?
Do as you like.
So it was.
What do you see?
Is that her?
Do you know what it is?
What could it be?
What did he do to you?
Is that all?
That is a long time.
You may go.
Did you see it?
Do they know him?
Which is it?
How was that?
Look at it this way.
Call him in.
What is it about?
What did you do then?
What time is it?
You can do it.
But who was she?
Will you come and see her?
Did you know her?
what has she to do with it?
And do you like her?
Do you know her?
And is that all?
That is what she did.
They said no more.
How did she do it?
You know how it is with her.
and so on, and so on.
How do you do?
Is it over?
Who are you?
Then how many are there?
What was he like?
And could she see him?
And do you like him?
but we can go and see.
So it is.
Do you see him?
The time will come.
When is it?
You can have some.
But what will you do?
What will you do, then?
Now there is no more to be said.
What is there to see?
Is that it?
Look over it.
What was it?
What is he like?
The time had come.
How did you know about it?
Did you know them?
What have you come for?
And who was that?
What do you make of it?
What can we do, then?
And what did you do then?
What is it all about?
but there was more to it than this.

Will that do?
But it has been so long.
Is she like him?

What other way is there to look at it?
Can one see from there?
So there it was.
Then there is more to do.
And all for what?
There were two of them.

So be it.
How would you like to have it?
But WHAT DID you see?
At what time?
Who and what are you?
There he is, she said.
Go on, he said.
You have it.
And what is that?
Did you see her?
Do as you will.
Then, how do you know?
How did he do it?
Then what are you up to now?
Are you there?
One or two?

Now is your time.
Did you know him?
There is but one thing to do.
