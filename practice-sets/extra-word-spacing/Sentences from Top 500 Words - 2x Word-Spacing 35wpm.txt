The little boy lay in his bed.
They know nothing about it.
Bring this with you.
The night was dark.
It might have done me good.
Keep clear of him.
is it come yet?
The whole night the tree stood still.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Who brought you up?
What have you done?
He was here a minute ago.
There is your old bed.
All was dark.
What can be done?
Oh, you are there.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Fly, my friend.
Oh, he is so kind.
Behind my bed.
Money is no object?
Bring them here.
Wonder is it like that.
The old man gave no answer.
All of this was possible.
Oh, that.
Yes, sit down.
What has he done?
She gave me her hand.
We are more strong together.
What kind of voice is it?
Yes, we know that.
Yes, and no.
We brought them in.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Well, what about my plan?
Why should my father fly?
What have they done with my work?
All that for nothing?
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Decide if you are going back home.
There was more to be done.
There is no possible way.
It stood behind the door.
There is a lot of people.
Sit down, said the old man.
It was hot.
You brought no one with you?
Well, miss?
Yes, very well.
Will you rest here a little?
They need a rest.
She could think of nothing more to say.
You know nothing about it.
Are they on foot?
That is possible.
If only they would be quick.
It is his voice.
He brought it with him for us to see.
It was a kind of language between us.
It is possible.
We are free to act and think.
Oh, take me with you.
Again came the voice.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
He had, to be sure, done much.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
What is power?
If you fall dont wait to get up.
There is no one in that room behind you.
You must stay with me.
Do you see that island?
Is it possible?
How can a little dog laugh?
How is that done?
But what then must be done?
Look at that dark water.
Of course it is.
He had made up his mind.
Just let us go free.
It is a real bed.
Nothing could have been better.
Yes and no.
It is very clear.
What did the letter contain?
You will fall.
Is my father in town?
Yes, go and find out.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Here is our plan.
The night was very dark.
Wait a minute.
Oh, but you were there?
It is all done.
Yes, you are right.
How long would you keep me in town?
Yes, there it is.
Then it is certain?
Very well, wait a minute.
Let me see your plan.
But how long ago?
See what you have done.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Oh, nothing.
And you can do nothing until then?
Yes, but what did she say?
Yes, go on.
You knew it, and said nothing?
Oh, do you know?
Did it all rest on me?
He stood up.
Just go to sleep.
Yes, he said.
But it must be done soon.
Laugh, if you will.
You know you must say yes.
A fine thing too.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
But they could see nothing.
It was a cold, dark night.
It must be done.
Oh, that is very simple.
It is nothing.
and so he decide he go back home.
All right then, sit down.
He will sleep an hour.
You love a certain person.
Nothing had come of it.
Stay where you are.
He must wait.
Wonder if he has a name.
I hear his voice in the house.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Like these in shape and size?
But she is nothing to me now.
Yes, what is it?
Well yes, you are right.
Perhaps he did.
Lead me to him.
Nothing at all.
He never said nothing.
And then the game began all over again.
The water ran dry.
Yes, she was back.
Never mind that.
Oh, if men only knew.
You are in my power.
Go in there and drive them out.
It was full of people.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
That is a fact.
Sit down, he said.
Yes, he did.
You are free to do so.
Go and rest.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Oh, just listen.
She got her hand free.
Oh, do as you like.
Oh, of course.
Of course she will.
Fine, very fine.
She was still game.
Bring it here.
Half the town was there.
Yes, my love?
Why, of course.
It was so long ago.
Then lead the way.
Quick, friend, quick.
And yet you said he had money.
Oh, all right.
Try to sleep.
Did she stay long?
It is no use, said a voice.
They all fall to the ground.
Oh let me in.
Nothing is more simple.
It is done.
He must be in the same boat as us.
Yes, once.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Did he fall?
Which box do you mean?
Yes, he said, all of it.
Oh, go on.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
It was right in front of us.
Play the game out.
It is time for bed.
He is in the box.
Go back to bed.
Nothing new under the sun.
This voice was that of my father.
It has to be done.
Leave the rest to me.
It must be done at once.
Clear my name.
He ran up to them.
And what have you done to me?
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
But let us see your plan.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Yes, to be sure.
My mind is made up.
You can hear that, miss?
The snow is deep.
It was very dark.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Behind every book is a man.
Oh, man.
It was so very long ago.
That was well done.
Never mind me.
Come, and we can rest together.
Oh, tell me.
Be back in a minute.
Is it certain?
They would cry.
You must have a rest.
Let her wait.
What brought you here?
But never mind that.
It was a warm night.
He left long ago.
Well, there he stood.
You better stay here all night.
But wait a minute.
Oh, this is too much.
Of course it might.
Then all was dark again.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
It was brought to me.
No, nothing at all.
How long ago?
Come quick.
Yes, all right.
Wait a second.
Answer me that, miss.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Clear the table.
Let us sit down.
We must be quick.
What has brought you here?
It was a record run.
That would be a fine thing.
The island was a mile long.
His first cry was for his father.
This is a test.
What more is to be done?
Take good note of it.
You must stay.
Did she fall?
The night is so long, and yet so short.
In a minute.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Better sit still.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Oh, no.
Yes, said the old man.
Well, sit down.
Where can you wait for me?
The whole day had been hot.
It is certain.
Let him go free?
Come back to us as soon as possible.
And he told you nothing?
Yes, it did.
Who gave it to you?
It was a very dark night.
He began to laugh.
But what must be done?
She began to cry.
What a game.
Can it be possible?
Why does the boat go so fast?
Yes, that is true.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Is that a fact?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
How was that possible?
His plan is very simple.
There, by the wheel.
He saw nothing.
He has a good voice still.
Wonder what he does.
Wait for me.
Oh, dont ask me.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
No, nothing of the kind.
Get to bed.
There is nothing more to be said.
Wait and see.
Well then, be quick.
Yes, it is true.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Yes, she could sing that.
He is among us.
What is done is done.
Dont laugh.
It was cold and dark.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Well, of course.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Yes, she said.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Oh, very well, he said.
In her name, then, let it be done.
He gave me this paper.
You can sleep here.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Your voice is that of a young man.
And sit in the dark?
And yet you are the better off?
Help me sit up.
It was a dark night.
It was done.
But that is nothing to us.
What have they done?
In that town there is a street.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Free to do what?
My mind was soon made up.
Clear the way.
Is he in bed?
Be quick, for the time is short.
Nothing could be more simple.
Oh, to be sure.
Nothing she can eat?
Then he must be a wonder.
At his side was a large green box.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Oh, come now.
She heard and saw nothing.
Of course he was right.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Now we must wait.
Her voice was low.
Is that possible?
Oh, do the best you can.
What age is he?
Of course they will.
His will be done.
How was it done?
Do you have my note?
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
The city was soon behind me.
This made him wonder more and more.
Money is power.
Good to rest once in a way.
Why did you bring him here?
Oh, take those off.
And here is the note.
Never mind how he came here.
Yes, of course.
Are you strong?
They call him a fine boy.
Well, sit down by me.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
And what a voice she has.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
He knew nothing.
Hold on a minute.
