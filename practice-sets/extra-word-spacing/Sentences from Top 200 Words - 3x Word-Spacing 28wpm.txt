Very well, he said.
Well, go on.
That is all one can say about her.
Where do you live?
Now it was time to act.
How did you get here?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Try it on.
You see it every day.
Much good that would be.
Then why are you here?
And what was his name?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Come with me, then.
Been back long?
There will just be time.
What do you think of him?
See, here it is.
How old are you?
He said that that would help.
In what year?
What on earth do you mean?
Here she is.
Play with them.
What do they say was the cause?
He went to him.
Is he big?
No, tell me.
Then will come our time.
But where are we to go?
When will he come back?
Give me more than that
Which house is it?
What you have just said is good, very good.
How can you tell?
Good day to you.
Such as what?
What does one live for?
Why is that?
But what about me?
Think of him.
Did you tell him?
What is that in your hand?
This for me?
Is she well?
What did you say your name was?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Then they will follow you?
Where do they get that?
You are most kind.
Are you at it again?
But he does so need a mother.
Tell me about it.
Very well, show him to me.
Is it all right?
Would you now like to look round my place?
There was no one near.
But he is right.
Do it for me.
And that was the end of it.
Now, you know me.
They had all been very good to us.
You think so?
Why, what is it, then?
Is this the man?
Tell me all about it.
Well then, what do you want?
Is there no one who can help me?
What more could a man ask for?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Tell me who made the world.
take them all.
And what are they made of?
He is at my house.
After three, he said.
We are who we say we are.
There is no place like home.
Will you try?
Now come here.
And how old were you at that time?
Where to, now?
But what does it mean?
And who is the man?
How do you take it?
Ask him to show up?
Do you want me to do it?
Is it large?
And how in the world did you find them?
How can you say that?
You can help me here.
Where did you place it?
Is that right?
What do you mean by that?
Where are you?
Show it to me.
Just look through it.
If you want to know, go and find out.
Just like me.
Where have you been?
Large or small?
Here is the way we put in the time.
What does he mean?
Come with me to the little house.
What does she think about me?
And it did me good.
Give it me.
The first act was over.
Show me the way.
There was work to do.
How did that help you?
What is in your hand?
It would be very kind of you.
What was his name?
And do you know why?
Where have they been?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
It is the same thing.
And what did he say?
What do you play?
Go and try.
Get out and play.
One, two, three.
It will take a little time.
It is great.
Well, all right.
There is no one here to see.
Where are they off to now?
That was very good.
Why, what do you mean?
Well, and what do you think?
Is that all you want?
That is just my point.
Well, did he?
Say what you want.
What would you have me do?
We are here.
How much are they?
This is the man.
where did she come from?
Why do you want water?
How on earth do you know?
Well, what do you think about it?
Can you help me find my way?
How old was she?
Are they like each other?
She has been with him many long years.
What does it all mean?
Have you been here long?
She came up to them.
Turn this way.
Well, tell me.
Where is he?
Move on, then.
Where is he now?
She had to tell him.
Good, he said.
Well, read it.
Give him air.
Is there some for me?
In what part of the house?
Here is my hand.
What do you think of her?
Why did he come?
For how much?
Three, he said.
What is your name?
Come and help me.
How could she say such a thing.
But it is just so with the world.
And they went home.
He was here.
do you come from the end of the world?
There, that does me good.
No, mother.
Give me your hand.
Give me my work.
What a good thing it would be.
He has more to give.
You must come now.
That is the end of her.
What have you been after?
Tell us all about it.
Do you think she was?
there are only two.
Can you point it out to me?
It is all the same.
That was a house to look at.
You are a good boy.
Well, here he is.
And have you been here long?
And where is this man?
Is he a good man?
But why do you ask?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
That is right.
And what about your mother?
This is the first act.
He was at work again.
Now tell me.
What could set you off in the first place?
But who was your mother?
Here it is, he said.
Look at me.
What do they want?
It is very high.
What was it you said to me?
There is the little boy.
And where is he now?
That would be very good.
How much do you want?
Well then, tell him so.
What will each of you give?
Who will tell her?
How did you get me out?
this one, too?
What on earth does this mean?
It is very kind of you.
You were near him.
Call me what you will, he said.
What do you think of this?
It was now his turn to look about him.
Tell me his name.
It must be where you put it.
It was high time.
But what did you want?
How does she use you?
And what did she say?
Well, and is that all?
Give me a light.
Where is she?
And what do you think?
Why are you like this?
Is it any good?
Think it over.
Now, what do you want with me?
Where did he come from?
Can you take me?
You are right.
They want more.
How long have you been here?
Where are you from?
Why are they here?
We must come back.
To what end?
Do you think so?
Where could he be?
Only two there now.
But where is he?
Get to work.
Follow me, said the man.
Time to get out.
Now we see the light.
And where is it?
What do you mean?
Are you back again?
Then what kind is it?
Where are you off to?
Will you take me to her?
Well, how are you?
There she is again.
Say no more about it.
We will say no more about it, then.
Why are you here?
Take some, she said.
Think what you will.
What could she mean by it?
What do you want me to do?
He will live.
Read that, she said.
Is it you or me?
Take this and this.
Get out of the way.
But you must.
What is his name?
Here it is.
How can you find out?
You must take me with you.
The world is before you.
Now where did they come from?
Why do you want to know?
Ask her, he said.
Too much for me now.
And a very good thing, too.
What will you say?
Were you here before me?
What did he say?
What do you think of that?
Where are we to turn for help?
They are here.
See, they are here.
Will you come with me?
She went on.
You must tell me.
He went on his way.
All in good time.
Say no more.
Good day, one and all.
What do you want?
Hand it in.
And off we go.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Some day you may ask me about it.
Show us where you live, said the man.
Read that, he said.
But where is it?
But this is the point.
This is my point.
Put it on.
He said too much.
You think so, too?
Where in the world did you come from?
Give it to me, then.
For some man.
Too much in the way.
What did he tell you?
What did you say that for?
Now, go home.
You are all very kind to me.
She was right.
Who is that man?
Come with me.
Where are we?
And why is that?
That is right, said the old man.
You can say what it is.
Very well then.
How can you think of such a thing?
Who are these men?
She was the cause of it all.
All right, then.
But why do you ask me?
She has a house?
You know, you see right through people.
Do you know me?
Show me the way he went.
Why is he here?
Too much of this.
Do you think so now?
What does all this mean?
What does she want?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
What do you want to ask these people?
And where is she, then?
He will ask for it.
At your house?
Are you here for good?
And in she went.
Where does he live?
And how did you find out?
Well, how did it go?
Tell us your name.
Well, what do you think?
You will get on in the world.
He was there too.
Think no more about that.
He was so kind.
And where was the place?
I would like to see her again in that.
How does he use it?
Is it as good now?
And what is her name?
There is more to tell.
Look at it other way round.
When will it take place?
That was a good time.
And what will they do with us?
Just look at her.
When will her mother come?
