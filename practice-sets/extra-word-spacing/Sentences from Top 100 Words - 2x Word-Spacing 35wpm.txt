Go on, he said.
Who was that?
There he is, do you see him?
Did you know her?
That will do, said he.
Is she like him?
And could she see him?
And how did you find out?
Is it over?
Who will go first?
That is a long time.
What have you come for?
And what did you see?
No one will come, she said.
Can it be?
What would she have said?
You can have some.
are you there?
Out of the way.
That was all she said.
Now is your time.
We have no water.
There you are.
Can you do that?
But he had no time.
Then how many are there?
What DO you know of him?
How is he?
What is that?
Do they know him?
And is that all?
But so it is.
But will he see it?
Who is she?
There were two of them.
Do as you like.
So that was the way.
When is it?
You have them?
There you are, he said.
What did they do?
How did she do it?
What was he like?
But what are you up to?
Do you know?
So it was.
And who was that?
How is she?
Do you know what it is?
And when will you call?
But how is that?
But WHAT DID you see?
Would you like some?
Now there is no more to be said.
Or so they said.
Would you do what he did?
what has she to do with it?
And do you like her?
That was it.
One or two?
Now what are we to do with you?
Do you see it?
Do you see him?
What do you make of it?
Look at it this way.
Is it like him?
Is that it?
What did he do to you?
What did you do then?
How do you do?
There he is, you see.
And what is that?
Do you know her?
Do you know him?
but there was more to it than this.
Did you see it?
What was it?
What is he like?
Who are you?
What can this be?
And what was it for?
Did you see her?
Did you know them?
There is but one thing to do.
And what do you make of it?
Look at him.
What are we to do?
Do you know what you look like?
So there it was.
What can we do, then?
You know how it is with her.
What is all this?
You can go.
But what is it?
What do you make of that?
But it was of no use.
What do you see?
Is it time?
You can do it.
Which is it?
What are you up to?
Then there is more to do.
What do they call you?
How can you know?
What is there to see?
Do you like him?
Then make it up.
At what time?
Now you know.
The time had come.
What other way is there to look at it?
Then who are you?
what is it?
So it is.
who can it be?
What was it about?
When was that?
What is it like?
Did you know him?
But who was she?
It was from you.
No was there one?
Are you there?
Is that all?
Can one see from there?
And all for what?
And who are you?
What is it about?
But what have they been up to?
What will you do, then?
who, then, are you?
So be it.
You may go.
Then, how do you know?
When was it?
Will you come and see her?
He said no.
But he had to have it.
At what number?
How are you?
How did you come by it?
But what will you do?
We have him.
Then what are you up to now?
but what if it is?
But how about you?
That is what she did.
Has it come to this?
What is it all about?
And what did you do then?
Look over it.
You know more than we do.
And do you like him?
What time is it?
How did he do it?
They said no more.
Had to look the other way.
Is that her?
Look at it.
There they are.
Is he there?
That will do, he said.
How was that?
And who is this?
and so on, and so on.
Will that do?
Look at them.
There he is, she said.
And has it come to this?
How did you know about it?
Come this way.
And what do you call her?
How long has he been there?
You have it.
but we can go and see.
Then what is it?
Who was he?
May we come in?
But it has been so long.
Tqhen you may go.
Call him in.
Do as you will.
How would you like to have it?
But when will that be?
What could it be?
She has it.
What is it for?
How is he now?
Who and what are you?
How can it be?
The time will come.
You have it.
That was it.
What do they call you?
And is that all?
What have you come for?
What did he do to you?
Do as you will.
How is he now?
What did they do?
What is it about?
And has it come to this?
And who are you?
Did you know him?
Who will go first?
And who is this?
Is that it?
Do you know what it is?
But what are you up to?
Tqhen you may go.
There were two of them.
And when will you call?
There you are.
There they are.
Do as you like.
The time will come.
So it was.
How is she?
What is all this?
Do you know him?
How would you like to have it?
And all for what?
What did you do then?
But what have they been up to?
Has it come to this?
Do you know?
That will do, said he.
We have him.
Would you like some?
But what will you do?
What would she have said?
How are you?
What time is it?
are you there?
What do you make of that?
You know how it is with her.
There he is, do you see him?
Is he there?
But WHAT DID you see?
Did you know her?
Then what is it?
And what was it for?
What are you up to?
But he had to have it.
You have them?
Who is she?
What other way is there to look at it?
Is that her?
But so it is.
Then there is more to do.
How did you know about it?
Do you know what you look like?
What is it like?
Go on, he said.
When is it?
How did she do it?
Then, how do you know?
Call him in.
We have no water.
How can it be?
What is it all about?
How was that?
but we can go and see.
Look at it this way.
Come this way.
Who was that?
There is but one thing to do.
That was all she said.
Or so they said.
How is he?
And do you like her?
That is what she did.
Then make it up.
Is that all?
Look at it.
Are you there?
And do you like him?
He said no.
Out of the way.
What is it for?
But how about you?
And could she see him?
Will you come and see her?
Do you see him?
So there it was.
How long has he been there?
What DO you know of him?
Which is it?
but there was more to it than this.
Is she like him?
You know more than we do.

But when will that be?
Is it like him?
At what time?
Will that do?
You can do it.
May we come in?
How do you do?
But it has been so long.
Who are you?
What could it be?
But what is it?
Who and what are you?
That is a long time.
And what is that?
And how did you find out?
No was there one?
What is there to see?
No one will come, she said.
Now is your time.
Now you know.
but what if it is?
How can you know?
Can it be?
How did you come by it?
who can it be?
Do you like him?
At what number?
So that was the way.
How did he do it?
Look over it.
Would you do what he did?
You can go.
And what did you see?
And what do you call her?
It was from you.
There he is, she said.
What can we do, then?
Can one see from there?
What do you see?
But who was she?
The time had come.

and so on, and so on.
You may go.
Can you do that?
What will you do, then?
Do they know him?
