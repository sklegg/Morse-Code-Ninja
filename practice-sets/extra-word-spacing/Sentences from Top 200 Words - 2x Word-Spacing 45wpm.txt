Now come here.
It is very kind of you.
You are most kind.
What does all this mean?
Get out and play.
What on earth does this mean?
She went on.
Put it on.
Much good that would be.
It is the same thing.
do you come from the end of the world?
How can you find out?
Very well, he said.
In what part of the house?
Do you think she was?
What does he mean?
What does it all mean?
What is your name?
Will you take me to her?
Do you think so?
You will get on in the world.
And where is it?
It is all the same.
He is at my house.
But where is he?
Try it on.
How long have you been here?
How does she use you?
What have you been after?
Is it all right?
What do you want me to do?
Where did you place it?
But where is it?
And what do you think?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Look at me.
This is the first act.
He was so kind.
Why did he come?
What is in your hand?
Think what you will.
She had to tell him.
Are you at it again?
And do you know why?
And how in the world did you find them?
And what was his name?
Three, he said.
Go and try.
Where have you been?
What would you have me do?
But who was your mother?
They are here.
Where are you?
Tell us all about it.
Come with me, then.
Read that, she said.
Now we see the light.
Who will tell her?
How old was she?
Where does he live?
Where have they been?
In what year?
No, mother.
Take some, she said.
Where did he come from?
Is she well?
Which house is it?
There is no one here to see.
I would like to see her again in that.
Large or small?
It was now his turn to look about him.
The world is before you.
There she is again.
What did you say your name was?
What do they say was the cause?
Give me my work.
That is the end of her.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
It is very high.
this one, too?
And where is this man?
But it is just so with the world.
And what is her name?
Ask her, he said.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Are they like each other?
Been back long?
How much are they?
Take this and this.
Now it was time to act.
When will he come back?
And they went home.
You are right.
Is there no one who can help me?
He said that that would help.
One, two, three.
The first act was over.
That is right, said the old man.
Say what you want.
Very well then.
Well, what do you think about it?
How much do you want?
And that was the end of it.
Can you take me?
They want more.
But what did you want?
Well, how are you?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
At your house?
Tell me all about it.
They had all been very good to us.
How did that help you?
Well, read it.
Here is my hand.
Now tell me.
What on earth do you mean?
How old are you?
What did he say?
And why is that?
take them all.
Where is she?
You see it every day.
This for me?
But he does so need a mother.
Come and help me.
And off we go.
Come with me.
But where are we to go?
That is just my point.
There is no place like home.
Can you point it out to me?
And where is she, then?
Is it you or me?
Have you been here long?
She came up to them.
Why, what do you mean?
Then they will follow you?
And what about your mother?
Who are these men?
Is it any good?
Are you here for good?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Here is the way we put in the time.
What is his name?
How did you get me out?
What do you think of her?
How could she say such a thing.
What will you say?
Only two there now.
He was at work again.
You are all very kind to me.
Call me what you will, he said.
Tell me about it.
Is there some for me?
See, here it is.
Why do you want to know?
What could set you off in the first place?
Is that all you want?
Think no more about that.
What do you think of this?
Why do you want water?
Just like me.
And where is he now?
We are who we say we are.
Do it for me.
Where are you off to?
Why, what is it, then?
Good day, one and all.
Too much for me now.
Where is he now?
Then what kind is it?
What do you think of him?
That was very good.
Where do they get that?
We are here.
For some man.
You must come now.
Do you want me to do it?
She has a house?
And where was the place?
But what does it mean?
And have you been here long?
where did she come from?
Just look at her.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
You can say what it is.
You are a good boy.
It will take a little time.
Say no more.
How did you get here?
And how did you find out?
How does he use it?
What was it you said to me?
There is more to tell.
We must come back.
Think it over.
It is great.
There is the little boy.
Can you help me find my way?
Well, and is that all?
Good, he said.
There was work to do.
Here she is.
Why are you like this?
He will live.
There was no one near.
How can you tell?
He will ask for it.
Tell me his name.
You think so?
Show me the way he went.
Well, go on.
He went on his way.
Follow me, said the man.
It was high time.
But why do you ask me?
There, that does me good.
How can you think of such a thing?
He went to him.
What a good thing it would be.
Where to, now?
And what will they do with us?
Good day to you.
Now where did they come from?
Get to work.
You were near him.
Then will come our time.
Well, did he?
There will just be time.
Here it is, he said.
Give him air.
Come with me to the little house.
Too much in the way.
Now, go home.
What do you want to ask these people?
He said too much.
Some day you may ask me about it.
Give me a light.
What do you mean by that?
What did you say that for?
Is that right?
Now, what do you want with me?
That was a good time.
What will each of you give?
Would you now like to look round my place?
Where could he be?
Who is that man?
there are only two.
Here it is.
Well, how did it go?
Get out of the way.
Show it to me.
No, tell me.
Do you think so now?
What do they want?
Move on, then.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Then why are you here?
Why is he here?
It must be where you put it.
Well then, tell him so.
He was here.
What do you want?
Read that, he said.
And what did she say?
You must tell me.
To what end?
You think so, too?
Well, all right.
She was the cause of it all.
All in good time.
What does she think about me?
Give it to me, then.
After three, he said.
What was his name?
For how much?
He has more to give.
How do you take it?
But he is right.
Turn this way.
Time to get out.
But you must.
Why is that?
Is it as good now?
But this is the point.
And it did me good.
Will you try?
Hand it in.
And what are they made of?
Such as what?
Think of him.
He was there too.
And a very good thing, too.
Tell me who made the world.
Give it me.
What did he tell you?
When will it take place?
Tell us your name.
She has been with him many long years.
Where are we to turn for help?
Show me the way.
But what about me?
What could she mean by it?
How on earth do you know?
Well, here he is.
And how old were you at that time?
That would be very good.
That is all one can say about her.
Is he big?
What is that in your hand?
Is this the man?
Very well, show him to me.
Will you come with me?
That was a house to look at.
Well, and what do you think?
Is he a good man?
What you have just said is good, very good.
What do you play?
If you want to know, go and find out.
Give me more than that
Is it large?
This is my point.
What do you mean?
How can you say that?
You must take me with you.
Too much of this.
All right, then.
And in she went.
What does one live for?
What do you think of that?
See, they are here.
And what did he say?
What more could a man ask for?
We will say no more about it, then.
Give me your hand.
Do you know me?
Play with them.
Just look through it.
Were you here before me?
Where are we?
Where is he?
You know, you see right through people.
Now, you know me.
Well, tell me.
Why are they here?
What does she want?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Are you back again?
Look at it other way round.
Well then, what do you want?
That is right.
Did you tell him?
This is the man.
She was right.
Well, what do you think?
Ask him to show up?
When will her mother come?
But why do you ask?
Where do you live?
Why are you here?
Say no more about it.
It would be very kind of you.
Where are you from?
You can help me here.
And who is the man?
Where are they off to now?
Where in the world did you come from?
Show us where you live, said the man.
