Can it be?
Who is she?
Then there is more to do.
And who was that?
How are you?
but there was more to it than this.
At what number?
But when will that be?
But so it is.
They said no more.
Is that her?
who, then, are you?
What is it all about?
You can go.
How is he?
And how did you find out?
Come this way.
Then what is it?
You can do it.
And what is that?
Is it like him?
what is it?
Go on, he said.
but what if it is?
Did you know them?
Then what are you up to now?
How did she do it?
Do you know him?
Which is it?
No one will come, she said.
She has it.
You know how it is with her.
There is but one thing to do.
But he had no time.
Then who are you?
Who and what are you?
What is it about?
So be it.
Did you know him?
Who are you?
Tqhen you may go.
There they are.
Who will go first?
What did he do to you?
What do you make of it?
what has she to do with it?
And is that all?
And all for what?
What DO you know of him?
How long has he been there?
What is that?
Is that it?
Who was that?
But it has been so long.
And what do you call her?
What was it?
And what do you make of it?
Did you see it?
It was from you.
And what did you do then?
Is it over?
There he is, you see.
Now what are we to do with you?
What did they do?
Do you know?
Do you know what you look like?
But what have they been up to?
Or so they said.
Will that do?
Can one see from there?
What other way is there to look at it?
How did he do it?
What can we do, then?
And who are you?
That is what she did.
Did you know her?
What could it be?
Has it come to this?
How did you come by it?
are you there?
There he is, do you see him?
What do they call you?
What is it like?
But what will you do?
Are you there?
How do you do?
No was there one?
So it was.
But will he see it?
That is a long time.
You can have some.
Is that all?
What did you do then?
But he had to have it.
You have it.
How would you like to have it?
Would you like some?
Then, how do you know?
What do you see?
What can this be?
When is it?
What was it about?
and so on, and so on.
And what did you see?
At what time?
What have you come for?
Do as you will.
Do you know what it is?
And when will you call?
So there it was.
How can you know?
What are we to do?
Did you see her?
How is she?
What was he like?
And what was it for?
Now there is no more to be said.
But what are you up to?
What is there to see?
Look at it this way.
What time is it?
And do you like her?
Is she like him?
You may go.
Do as you like.
There were two of them.
We have him.
And has it come to this?
What are you up to?
Had to look the other way.
Would you do what he did?
How can it be?
He said no.
So it is.
But what is it?
What will you do, then?
There he is, she said.
How was that?
But who was she?
That will do, he said.
Is it time?
But it was of no use.
Call him in.
What is it for?
Now you know.
Do they know him?
Look at him.
What is all this?
There you are.
And who is this?
And could she see him?
But WHAT DID you see?
There you are, he said.
Do you see it?
The time had come.
That was it.
So that was the way.
Will you come and see her?
Then make it up.
But how is that?
What would she have said?
What do you make of that?
You have them?
Is he there?
How did you know about it?
Do you see him?
who can it be?
Then how many are there?
Who was he?
And do you like him?
What is he like?
We have no water.
Look over it.
Do you like him?
When was that?
How is he now?
but we can go and see.
One or two?
Look at it.
Now is your time.
Look at them.
Out of the way.
That will do, said he.
May we come in?
Do you know her?
Can you do that?
You know more than we do.
That was all she said.
But how about you?
When was it?
The time will come.
And all for what?
Then there is more to do.
How did she do it?
Then, how do you know?
Do as you like.
What have you come for?
and so on, and so on.
But it was of no use.
But he had no time.
There he is, she said.
But who was she?
She has it.
You know more than we do.
And could she see him?
And what did you do then?
What did they do?
Is she like him?
Look at him.
Or so they said.
but we can go and see.
And who was that?
Then what are you up to now?
Will you come and see her?
What can this be?
but there was more to it than this.
So be it.
And who is this?
What are you up to?
How can you know?
And do you like him?
What was he like?
Is that it?
Can one see from there?
You may go.
That will do, said he.
Look over it.
Then how many are there?
But how is that?
So there it was.
But so it is.
At what time?
How are you?
Is it over?
There were two of them.
When was it?
Do they know him?
Who was he?
You can go.
What is it all about?
Do you like him?
You know how it is with her.
What did he do to you?
How is she?
How did you come by it?
Go on, he said.
Do you know her?
That was all she said.
Then make it up.
Would you do what he did?
What is there to see?
But what will you do?
That will do, he said.
What would she have said?
How can it be?
When was that?
Then what is it?
And what is that?
What DO you know of him?
And what did you see?
But will he see it?
who can it be?
Will that do?
What is all this?
But what have they been up to?
Can you do that?
That is a long time.
We have him.
And has it come to this?
But what are you up to?
Is it time?
Are you there?
Now you know.
Now there is no more to be said.
You can do it.
So it is.
And how did you find out?
Out of the way.
Call him in.
How did he do it?
There you are.
How would you like to have it?
How did you know about it?
But when will that be?
How do you do?
What time is it?
What other way is there to look at it?
There he is, do you see him?
The time had come.
Did you know her?
Had to look the other way.
Who and what are you?
Which is it?
But how about you?
What was it about?
But WHAT DID you see?
Look at it this way.
who, then, are you?
One or two?
what has she to do with it?
What is he like?

Has it come to this?

Now is your time.
Look at them.

Look at it.
No one will come, she said.
Who are you?
Who will go first?

He said no.
What did you do then?
You have it.
