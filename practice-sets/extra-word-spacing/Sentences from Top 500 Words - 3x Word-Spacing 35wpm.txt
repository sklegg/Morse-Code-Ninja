It is certain.
But wait a minute.
Yes, she was back.
You love a certain person.
Yes, go and find out.
Sit down, said the old man.
Be back in a minute.
Oh, very well, he said.
Oh, come now.
What age is he?
What is done is done.
What have they done?
You must have a rest.
What more is to be done?
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
My mind is made up.
And yet you are the better off?
Yes, we know that.
Yes, she said.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Nothing could have been better.
There is a lot of people.
Is he in bed?
This voice was that of my father.
It was brought to me.
Yes, my love?
is it come yet?
He brought it with him for us to see.
Let me see your plan.
But they could see nothing.
Well, sit down by me.
Why should my father fly?
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Oh, just listen.
Decide if you are going back home.
But that is nothing to us.
Keep clear of him.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
It was a cold, dark night.
He left long ago.
You know nothing about it.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Oh, if men only knew.
Why does the boat go so fast?
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Well yes, you are right.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
It has to be done.
You can sleep here.
Behind my bed.
Yes, that is true.
Clear the table.
His first cry was for his father.
He began to laugh.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
They would cry.
Never mind me.
Oh, you are there.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Behind every book is a man.
And here is the note.
All right then, sit down.
Well, but where can he fly to?
He is in the box.
Yes, once.
Hold on a minute.
Are they on foot?
Yes, there it is.
Oh, tell me.
How long would you keep me in town?
Oh, do as you like.
and so he decide he go back home.
Wait a minute.
What a game.
You knew it, and said nothing?
There is your old bed.
In a minute.
It was cold and dark.
Stay where you are.
No, nothing of the kind.
Well, of course.
Perhaps he did.
You know you must say yes.
Yes, said the old man.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Yes, and no.
What brought you here?
Go back to bed.
They all fall to the ground.
Is that a fact?
Of course it might.
But it must be done soon.
Wait a second.
Well then, be quick.
It was done.
We are free to act and think.
Wonder if he has a name.
Of course it is.
They need a rest.
It is time for bed.
But let us see your plan.
He gave me this paper.
Yes, all right.
Money is power.
Where can you wait for me?
Just let us go free.
Like these in shape and size?
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Fly, my friend.
He must wait.
Oh, how can you sleep?
The night was dark.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Of course they will.
Is it possible?
It was a kind of language between us.
Go and rest.
It is all done.
Oh, but you were there?
Yes and no.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Free to do what?
Wait for me.
It must be done.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Yes, but what did she say?
We must be quick.
Oh, take me with you.
What kind of voice is it?
There was more to be done.
Yes, he said.
There is no possible way.
Yes, that was a picture book.
That would be a fine thing.
We brought them in.
Oh, do the best you can.
How long ago?
If only they would be quick.
She was still game.
Nothing new under the sun.
Answer me that, miss.
But she is nothing to me now.
How was that possible?
You brought no one with you?
Go in there and drive them out.
Is it certain?
Never mind how he came here.
Nothing is more simple.
But what then must be done?
And sit in the dark?
This is a test.
Oh, that is very simple.
Oh, that.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Look at that dark water.
Are you strong?
She began to cry.
Nothing could be more simple.
The whole night the tree stood still.
No, nothing at all.
It stood behind the door.
Yes, go on.
Laugh, if you will.
Oh, dont ask me.
I hear his voice in the house.
His plan is very simple.
It is very clear.
She heard and saw nothing.
He knew nothing.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
It is a real bed.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Who gave it to you?
Of course she will.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
The island was a mile long.
A fine thing too.
Oh let me in.
Oh, he is so kind.
The night was very dark.
Come, and we can rest together.
And you can do nothing until then?
Very well, wait a minute.
Oh, all right.
He had made up his mind.
And he told you nothing?
There, by the wheel.
It is done.
Yes, of course.
Do you see that island?
He will sleep an hour.
Play the game out.
Lead me to him.
See what you have done.
Oh, of course.
Nothing she can eat?
It was so long ago.
It is no use, said a voice.
He had, to be sure, done much.
But never mind that.
Did he fall?
Nothing at all.
The snow is deep.
How is that done?
Money is no object?
Let him go free?
It is nothing.
In her name, then, let it be done.
What can be done?
Take good note of it.
Oh, man.
It is possible.
Just go to sleep.
Again came the voice.
What did the letter contain?
Yes, but only for you and me.
Bring it here.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Well, miss?
Did it all rest on me?
Will you rest here a little?
It was so very long ago.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Try to sleep.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Yes, he did.
Well, what about my plan?
Come quick.
Dont laugh.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Then lead the way.
He has a good voice still.
And what a voice she has.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Oh, nothing.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
But what must be done?
What have you done?
Why did you bring him here?
It was hot.
Here is our plan.
It was full of people.
The whole day had been hot.
It was a very dark night.
This made him wonder more and more.
You must stay with me.
All of this was possible.
Let her wait.
The city was soon behind me.
She could think of nothing more to say.
It might have done me good.
What has brought you here?
He was here a minute ago.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Yes, what is it?
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Of course he was right.
You can hear that, miss?
What have they done with my work?
It was a warm night.
Oh, no.
Quick, friend, quick.
That is a fact.
It must be done at once.
Her voice was low.
Oh, do you know?
How can a little dog laugh?
Then all was dark again.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Leave the rest to me.
That is possible.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Yes, sit down.
He never said nothing.
Bring them here.
She got her hand free.
Oh, to be sure.
Yes, you are right.
Oh, this is too much.
Clear the way.
His will be done.
Is my father in town?
And then the game began all over again.
Help me sit up.
You will fall.
Yes, she could sing that.
What is power?
In that town there is a street.
It is his voice.
Oh, take those off.
He is among us.
Fine, very fine.
Better sit still.
You are in my power.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Do you have my note?
Then it is certain?
Then he must be a wonder.
Who brought you up?
There is nothing more to be said.
All was dark.
They call him a fine boy.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Wait and see.
At his side was a large green box.
Nothing had come of it.
Bring this with you.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Good to rest once in a way.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Never mind that.
Half the town was there.
Wonder what he does.
Yes, it is true.
He stood up.
She gave me her hand.
Sit down, he said.
You must stay.
Now we must wait.
The old man gave no answer.
Let us sit down.
You better stay here all night.
He must be in the same boat as us.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
It was very dark.
Did she fall?
But how long ago?
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
He saw nothing.
And yet you said he had money.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Oh, go on.
It was a record run.
How was it done?
Is that possible?
Did she stay long?
It was a dark night.
Yes, it did.
Yes, very well.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
They know nothing about it.
Can it be possible?
Come back to us as soon as possible.
The water ran dry.
We are more strong together.
That was well done.
Well, there he stood.
Clear my name.
You are free to do so.
And what have you done to me?
Get to bed.
It was right in front of us.
He ran up to them.
Yes, to be sure.
All that for nothing?
Wonder is it like that.
What has he done?
Well, sit down.
Why, of course.
Which box do you mean?
My mind was soon made up.
