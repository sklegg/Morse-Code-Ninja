How did she do it?
What was he like?
But what have they been up to?
How can you know?
What is it for?
Then who are you?
Do you see him?
That is what she did.
There he is, do you see him?
When was it?
It was from you.
And what is that?
Will you come and see her?
At what number?
Then how many are there?
You can do it.
May we come in?
Do you like him?
There he is, you see.
What did they do?
And what do you make of it?
Do you know?
That will do, said he.
He said no.
Now you know.
Do as you will.
What do they call you?
Look at it this way.
How long has he been there?
And do you like her?
Then there is more to do.
So that was the way.
That will do, he said.
We have him.
what has she to do with it?
Can it be?
You know how it is with her.
Come this way.
Is it over?
Can one see from there?
But it was of no use.
What was it?
Do as you like.
Is he there?
and so on, and so on.
What was it about?
What can we do, then?
How did he do it?
Now is your time.
What have you come for?
Did you see it?
And what did you do then?
Do you know him?
Who will go first?
Look over it.
But so it is.
How is she?
How did you come by it?
Is that her?
What could it be?
Do they know him?
What do you see?
Now what are we to do with you?
But WHAT DID you see?
And do you like him?
How would you like to have it?
But who was she?
Who is she?
There he is, she said.
What is all this?
And who was that?
What would she have said?
Did you know them?
Who are you?
Had to look the other way.
So it is.
Did you know her?
Would you do what he did?
So it was.
How are you?
What is he like?
Look at it.
Who was that?
The time will come.
She has it.
How is he?
But he had no time.
And when will you call?
So there it was.
but there was more to it than this.
Will that do?
What time is it?
There were two of them.
Call him in.
Do you know her?
Go on, he said.
But will he see it?
You have it.
So be it.
How is he now?
But what are you up to?
But how about you?
What other way is there to look at it?
Is it time?
Is that all?
The time had come.
There is but one thing to do.
What do you make of it?
No was there one?
When is it?
Then what are you up to now?
That was all she said.
They said no more.
But what will you do?
Or so they said.
Then what is it?
Do you know what it is?
There you are, he said.
Are you there?
There they are.
are you there?
who can it be?
Is it like him?
Do you know what you look like?
How can it be?
Now there is no more to be said.
And what did you see?
You can go.
Then, how do you know?
Which is it?
That was it.
There you are.
Tqhen you may go.
What is it all about?
How do you do?
Would you like some?
What did he do to you?
What are you up to?
Is she like him?
What DO you know of him?
What is that?
Who and what are you?
Do you see it?
What are we to do?
You have them?
but what if it is?
And what do you call her?
You know more than we do.
What is it like?
At what time?
What is it about?
We have no water.
No one will come, she said.
Has it come to this?
Can you do that?
And who is this?
but we can go and see.
Look at them.
And is that all?
That is a long time.
Did you see her?
And all for what?
who, then, are you?
And who are you?
And has it come to this?
But when will that be?
what is it?
How was that?
Look at him.
And how did you find out?
What do you make of that?
What did you do then?
But what is it?
You can have some.
But how is that?
When was that?
Who was he?
What can this be?
One or two?
But it has been so long.
What is there to see?
And what was it for?
But he had to have it.
What will you do, then?
Then make it up.
How did you know about it?
You may go.
Out of the way.
Is that it?
Did you know him?
And could she see him?
How did she do it?
What do they call you?
She has it.
Would you do what he did?
But when will that be?
There he is, she said.
Who was he?
What did you do then?
And what do you make of it?
But how about you?
Are you there?
And all for what?
We have no water.
How did you know about it?
And how did you find out?
What could it be?
That will do, he said.
Is that her?
what is it?
What other way is there to look at it?
How did you come by it?
Did you know her?
Would you like some?
What can we do, then?
But he had to have it.
Now is your time.
How do you do?
And who are you?
what has she to do with it?
And when will you call?
But will he see it?
Is he there?
Had to look the other way.
So be it.
It was from you.
Look at it.
Then make it up.
And what did you see?
There you are, he said.
There he is, you see.
Did you know him?
And what is that?
Will that do?
Then what is it?
What DO you know of him?
Do you know her?
What was he like?
Do you see him?
Will you come and see her?
but there was more to it than this.
There they are.
No was there one?
Do they know him?
Out of the way.
Do you know what you look like?
What is it for?
There he is, do you see him?
Then how many are there?
But what is it?
Who will go first?
That will do, said he.
What is he like?
Do you know him?
Tqhen you may go.
Can it be?
Do as you like.
What time is it?
How is she?
What do you see?
And is that all?
How can it be?
You know how it is with her.
And could she see him?
What have you come for?
But how is that?
When was it?
But what have they been up to?
There were two of them.
You know more than we do.
Do you know?
May we come in?
When is it?
Is that all?
What is all this?
Is she like him?
Go on, he said.
What is it like?
What will you do, then?
Did you know them?
Has it come to this?
You can have some.
Who was that?
What is there to see?
Then, how do you know?
Do you see it?

How is he now?
and so on, and so on.
Is it over?
So there it was.
The time will come.
What did they do?
So that was the way.
When was that?
You can go.
At what time?
That is a long time.
How long has he been there?
How would you like to have it?
One or two?
What would she have said?
Call him in.
Who and what are you?
How is he?
What is that?
You may go.

They said no more.
What can this be?
Now what are we to do with you?
No one will come, she said.
Is that it?

Can one see from there?
How did he do it?
Is it like him?
He said no.
Then who are you?
