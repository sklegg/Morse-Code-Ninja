She is still here?
Come here, my friend.
Well, what next?
She came over last night.
What did he answer?
Is it in the city?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Tell her to begin.
Just cut it out, will you?
Sure of what?
What was the name of the man who took it?
He had only one night more to live.
Come over in the sun.
He is at sea.
What did he say in the letter?
The children will live just the same.
Now or never.
Let him answer us.
Have you got that?
So it always was.
You must study.
No, said the Tree.
Dont say that to me.
Dont you want any?
But then you would be close to the sea?
But then it will be too late.
Let me know at once when you will start.
Who should it be?
But you must never tell.
What was left of him?
It was his own room.
One of us will be here all night.
Cut your hand open?
Do you know where he is?
Let me get to work.
Do you know how he made his mark?
There, do you hear?
Watch over him.
Which story was it?
Both of us.
Do you hear that?
Few had found it.
A call for help, you thought?
And now, good night.
And then we may begin.
He could run no more.
No, that can never be.
Where is the river?
So they got out and went in.
There to the left.
How many are left?
They are hard at it.
Why should they?
She never came back.
Let me say one thing.
Let them have it.
Come, let us be men.
Let me see it.
But why dont you want to take it?
Why do you stop here?
You got me?
Let me look.
Why should this be so?
Think of my father.
Where have you been this long while?
Let us go back.
And why should they?
This is my country.
Do you know what he did last night?
It is so very kind of you both.
Why, it was one of his own men.
He may come close.
It was like new life to him.
Come let us see them.
Have you been at sea?
No, dont.
Stop, let me show you the way.
Who said four?
Only, dont look back.
That is the idea.
It was white.
Let me hear your story.
Let her go.
He then said, It is time to start.
Come eat with me.
Take care.
Let me get on with my work.
what river is it?
And there are four of you?
Let me go back.
How would they stop it?
Here he is at last.
Who did you learn that from?
If you know, why dont you tell?
Where has she run off to?
Do you have a car?
At this time of my life, no.
We got to let that go.
Dont tell me.
Cut him down.
Keep watch all night.
See him grow up.
Here is the book.
What do you think when you hear music?
Dont you think so?
But it was very late.
She is my friend.
What do you think of the music?
Life is all right.
One never has too much.
And who is this friend?
She might be at his house.
At four, she said.
Let us go in.
They dont care.
It would seem so.
Is my father here?
Are we too late?
We found it.
You saw him?
It is well thought of.
Have you got it?
And this food?
And what did you do with that letter?
It will be too late.
But take care.
Off with her head.
Stop, said he.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Now let me have it.
it took all that time to come over the water.
What country does he come from?
This took him some time.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Our own people must come first.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Come at once.
There was no letter for me.
Where could you keep it?
Just cut it out.
It must be in her own house.
One was on a white horse.
The sun had set long since.
Let me hear what it is.
That was the first night.
Good for the country.
A second man got up and went out.
No, never.
He came at once.
We should look at this.
He is always at it.
We got under way at last.
What should he say?
Let me go to the door.
You have a car?
By and by he got it.
Do you have the letter?
The other night she left.
Why, dont you hear it?
What a night it has been.
You took it.
Are we late?
Who let you in?
You might want it.
Just a few.
Any book will tell you that.
It is always so.
Have you found it?
Never see him again.
Why is he cross with me?
But now it is too late.
Tell us a story.
They dont know their own country.
Look at his face.
Keep to the left.
Let him follow me.
We dont see it like that.
He might still be up.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
To the left.
Let him grow up with you.
Let me in.
Music is a good thing.
Will you never learn?
Good night, friend.
Well, run back to her.
What a start that was.
Can you hear me?
But it is the same with any life.
They always know.
Who was the letter from?
It is music.
You should take me there one day.
Open the door.
We must go at once.
Off with his head.
Does he never go out?
Here is the letter.
First turn to the left.
Why dont you want to go?
At last we have a man.
Can you stand?
So he began to help.
Are you sure?
One night more and he would be on his way.
And he left the room.
How much have you got?
It was the first thing he thought of.
It is from your father.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
You are right, father.
You found him?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Say good night.
Let me see her.
Was you in my room?
But watch over him.
How did it begin?
How could you begin?
But you got to play music for them.
Now you must eat.
That night we were just in time.
He said at last.
Point it at his horse.
Let me be and let me live.
Who found them out?
Do we stop here?
There is only food for one.
Give me the letter.
Let us start, then.
When did you begin?
It was then time to start.
We may be too late.
This took place at his house, in his room.
He has children of his own.
Well, read the letter again.
What is your real name?
And your children?
Why, is it late?
There were few near me.
Who took him out of it?
This is real.
She got up.
How many children?
And now let us go home.
Where is this city?
What is life to you?
And then they began to fish.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Let us cross over.
What did you hear?
Go to your father.
Who could have thought it?
No, said her father.
Is he a real father?
There was no answer.
Do you often come back?
What was it that you thought?
Are you sure of it?
Watch him, he said.
Why dont you play?
But it is all all too late now.
But are you sure of that?
He is my friend.
And what did you learn from him?
We might learn a thing or two.
Still, you never know.
Let me have a word with you.
Then, good night.
She came in just now by the back door.
Who can answer for that?
Take care of him.
Good night again.
Dont move, he said.
These were the first people we saw.
You must eat now.
Is it far?
We were together.
Let me see him at once.
We are very far from that.
But they may still come here.
No, stop.
Just set still and take it like a man.
What do you hear?
He saw his men draw back.
You are sure of that?
My father is right.
Are you my friend?
What would you have me do with my life?
Stop and think.
And she left the room.
But she saw no one?
Is that far?
We must begin again.
She saw it.
It was very hard.
She must have a hard time with him.
Write an answer.
Then let me have a word with you.
Call the next one.
Have you never been there?
He had two left feet.
We got one and they got one.
They never did it again.
So, once more, good night.
Let me out.
So take care of me.
It is a long story.
Do you want some more to eat?
We never thought of that.
Do you hear me?
It was the last day of the year.
Always the same, year after year.
Ask one of those men.
Dont you like it?
They came over last night.
He has been been found.
Always the same with you people.
Which end is his head?
But it would be in the paper.
Keep to the right.
There are only four of us.
They may tell us to open it.
But let us walk.
Do you want to cross?
She saw no one?
Tell me more.
They are always the same.
Right here it began.
It might help.
This is what began it all.
In the country?
No, why should he?
For once you are right.
It is open?
But hard to tell.
You are sure of it?
Here we see the boy at school.
Let me see him.
We should ask him.
You must never tell.
You must walk.
He is my father.
Did you see his eye?
But what did you hear?
We are together.
Dont you see that?
You will answer for it.
Well, let us be sure of that.
How could you let him go so far?
Here is the paper.
Is there any answer?
They never come back.
