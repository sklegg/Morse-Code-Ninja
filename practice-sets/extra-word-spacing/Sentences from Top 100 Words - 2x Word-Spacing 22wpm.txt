And what did you do then?
You can have some.
Did you see it?
Call him in.
Then what is it?
Then what are you up to now?
Look at him.
Would you do what he did?
Do you see him?
but what if it is?
And do you like her?
What is he like?
No was there one?
How are you?
Do you know her?
What did they do?
There he is, you see.
What did he do to you?
And could she see him?
How did you come by it?
Then who are you?
At what time?
What is it about?
At what number?
No one will come, she said.
How long has he been there?
Which is it?
So it was.
You know more than we do.
who, then, are you?
But who was she?
So it is.
You have it.
What was he like?
Is he there?
But will he see it?
Come this way.
what has she to do with it?
How was that?
How did she do it?
Did you know him?
Who are you?
But when will that be?
Do you know?
When is it?
And what do you call her?
He said no.
Will that do?
When was it?
That is a long time.
They said no more.
Now there is no more to be said.
Is it time?
That was all she said.
You may go.
That will do, said he.
How is she?
And who was that?
But how about you?
There they are.
Out of the way.
and so on, and so on.
Go on, he said.
Who was that?
but there was more to it than this.
What can we do, then?
Now what are we to do with you?
Is that her?
Did you see her?
How did you know about it?
Look at it.
But WHAT DID you see?
How do you do?
What is that?
And has it come to this?
But he had to have it.
What are we to do?
May we come in?
You have them?
Is that it?
What is it for?
When was that?
but we can go and see.
But what have they been up to?
Did you know her?
Can one see from there?
What time is it?
But so it is.
are you there?
Then, how do you know?
And how did you find out?
Do as you will.
Then make it up.
That was it.
What can this be?
Then how many are there?
What was it about?
But he had no time.
who can it be?
what is it?
The time had come.
What would she have said?
You can go.
We have him.
What do you make of that?
Do as you like.
There he is, do you see him?
Now you know.
You can do it.
Now is your time.
That will do, he said.
There you are.
Will you come and see her?
Tqhen you may go.
What DO you know of him?
One or two?
What do you see?
Are you there?
What was it?
And when will you call?
What is all this?
Or so they said.
Is that all?
How would you like to have it?
Can it be?
What is there to see?
Is she like him?
Do you know what it is?
What did you do then?
Would you like some?
Look at it this way.
Then there is more to do.
What have you come for?
And what do you make of it?
Look at them.
You know how it is with her.
Is it like him?
Do you like him?
And who is this?
So that was the way.
Did you know them?
There you are, he said.
What will you do, then?
What could it be?
And what was it for?
There is but one thing to do.
Who will go first?
So be it.
We have no water.
How is he?
Has it come to this?
Look over it.
And who are you?
But what will you do?
She has it.
Do you know him?
There were two of them.
And what is that?
Had to look the other way.
And is that all?
What do you make of it?
Who was he?
But what is it?
What are you up to?
That is what she did.
It was from you.
Do you see it?
But it was of no use.
And do you like him?
But how is that?
There he is, she said.
What do they call you?
Can you do that?
Who and what are you?
The time will come.
And all for what?
But it has been so long.
What is it all about?
How can you know?
And what did you see?
Is it over?
Do you know what you look like?
How can it be?
How is he now?
So there it was.
Who is she?
How did he do it?
Do they know him?
What other way is there to look at it?
What is it like?
But what are you up to?
And who are you?
Did you know her?
What time is it?
What is it like?
Did you see it?
What could it be?
Now what are we to do with you?
There they are.
Do you know what it is?
What DO you know of him?
But so it is.
So that was the way.
Go on, he said.
but there was more to it than this.
Then what is it?
What is it for?
Who was that?
But he had to have it.
But what is it?
May we come in?
Is it like him?
Then make it up.
What are you up to?
And all for what?
What other way is there to look at it?
It was from you.
Are you there?
They said no more.
But will he see it?
Call him in.
No was there one?
Is that her?
but what if it is?
And has it come to this?
What was it?
Do you know what you look like?
Tqhen you may go.
Then, how do you know?
Or so they said.
At what time?
What have you come for?
We have no water.

And could she see him?
That was all she said.
Do you know?
Now you know.
The time had come.
What do they call you?
How are you?
And what did you see?
But he had no time.
How did he do it?
and so on, and so on.
That is a long time.
What are we to do?
How did you know about it?
What is it all about?
How did she do it?
How was that?
Is he there?
Had to look the other way.
But it has been so long.
How would you like to have it?
Did you know him?
But how about you?

Would you do what he did?
Do you like him?
What is that?
How is he?
You can do it.
What can this be?
Who is she?
who, then, are you?
Will that do?
And how did you find out?
Who are you?
Then how many are there?
Which is it?
What will you do, then?
Do as you like.
And what do you make of it?
Is she like him?
There is but one thing to do.
How is he now?

What do you make of it?
And do you like him?
So it was.

When was it?
Will you come and see her?
You know more than we do.
One or two?
But what have they been up to?
Is it over?
And when will you call?
