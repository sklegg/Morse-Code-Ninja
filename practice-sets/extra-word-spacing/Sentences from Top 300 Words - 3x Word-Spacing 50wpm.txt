Let me go to the door.
Who said four?
What country does he come from?
Are you sure?
It was then time to start.
Come at once.
Dont you think so?
He then said, It is time to start.
You must walk.
She might be at his house.
They came over last night.
Who found them out?
They always know.
Which story was it?
Is he a real father?
Stop, let me show you the way.
At last we have a man.
Let me be and let me live.
You are sure of it?
What would you have me do with my life?
And what did you do with that letter?
Are you my friend?
Write an answer.
Few had found it.
We found it.
Now let me have it.
Let me say one thing.
He is always at it.
Do you hear that?
Let me have a word with you.
First turn to the left.
It is a long story.
You will answer for it.
Why dont you play?
Well, what next?
it took all that time to come over the water.
So it always was.
Do you want to cross?
But it is the same with any life.
Take care of him.
Stop and think.
Let me go back.
How much have you got?
Where could you keep it?
Why is he cross with me?
He is at sea.
How would they stop it?
They are always the same.
Let us go in.
And who is this friend?
But let us walk.
Then, good night.
What do you think when you hear music?
But they may still come here.
Do we stop here?
Are we too late?
Good night again.
There are only four of us.
Can you stand?
Why, dont you hear it?
But why dont you want to take it?
How did it begin?
One night more and he would be on his way.
But now it is too late.
She is still here?
Here is the book.
She saw no one?
We got one and they got one.
What do you think of the music?
There was no answer.
Is that far?
Right here it began.
Where is the river?
They may tell us to open it.
Never see him again.
They never did it again.
Let him follow me.
Why should they?
Is there any answer?
Keep to the right.
Why, it was one of his own men.
It might help.
That was the first night.
Where is this city?
But you got to play music for them.
Can you hear me?
This is what began it all.
He saw his men draw back.
To the left.
Come, let us be men.
But then it will be too late.
Here he is at last.
Any book will tell you that.
Come eat with me.
Stop, said he.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
But take care.
Let them have it.
Let me in.
Have you got it?
Here we see the boy at school.
This took place at his house, in his room.
No, said her father.
Here is the letter.
The sun had set long since.
But what did you hear?
Now you must eat.
She is my friend.
At four, she said.
Tell her to begin.
Point it at his horse.
We are together.
Dont move, he said.
And then they began to fish.
He may come close.
It must be in her own house.
What was it that you thought?
Our own people must come first.
Let me see him.
Off with his head.
Let me get on with my work.
You got me?
What is life to you?
But are you sure of that?
Just a few.
It is music.
Are we late?
It is from your father.
We got to let that go.
Keep watch all night.
A call for help, you thought?
Does he never go out?
Still, you never know.
And he left the room.
There is only food for one.
So he began to help.
This is my country.
Look at his face.
And what did you learn from him?
See him grow up.
No, that can never be.
You must study.
Is it far?
How many are left?
And she left the room.
Let me see her.
It is so very kind of you both.
Always the same with you people.
We are very far from that.
Let me get to work.
He might still be up.
She came over last night.
So, once more, good night.
Always the same, year after year.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Do you know what he did last night?
What is your real name?
We got under way at last.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Dont tell me.
He could run no more.
What did he say in the letter?
We may be too late.
They never come back.
But watch over him.
The other night she left.
We were together.
No, dont.
Have you been at sea?
That night we were just in time.
Let me see it.
Where has she run off to?
For once you are right.
You must never tell.
Sure of what?
She came in just now by the back door.
Dont say that to me.
He has children of his own.
Do you often come back?
Was you in my room?
You are right, father.
My father is right.
Do you know how he made his mark?
Dont you like it?
In the country?
What a night it has been.
What should he say?
Let her go.
Then let me have a word with you.
Life is all right.
We dont see it like that.
Take care.
We never thought of that.
And now let us go home.
She must have a hard time with him.
You might want it.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Who was the letter from?
They dont care.
Dont you see that?
Keep to the left.
You must eat now.
It will be too late.
There were few near me.
Who let you in?
So take care of me.
It is always so.
One was on a white horse.
These were the first people we saw.
Is it in the city?
Dont you want any?
No, stop.
Let him grow up with you.
But hard to tell.
One never has too much.
And why should they?
We should ask him.
But then you would be close to the sea?
This is real.
It was like new life to him.
Cut him down.
He came at once.
Call the next one.
Have you never been there?
Now or never.
Just cut it out.
Go to your father.
Well, run back to her.
Just cut it out, will you?
But it would be in the paper.
Give me the letter.
Come over in the sun.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Well, read the letter again.
He is my father.
It was the last day of the year.
Open the door.
How many children?
Let us cross over.
One of us will be here all night.
It was white.
Let me see him at once.
She got up.
Have you found it?
He has been been found.
Who can answer for that?
And now, good night.
And there are four of you?
what river is it?
Where have you been this long while?
Let him answer us.
And your children?
That is the idea.
She never came back.
Did you see his eye?
Both of us.
Just set still and take it like a man.
We must go at once.
Tell me more.
You have a car?
Watch him, he said.
He is my friend.
What was the name of the man who took it?
Are you sure of it?
And then we may begin.
No, said the Tree.
Do you want some more to eat?
Off with her head.
Who could have thought it?
Watch over him.
Tell us a story.
A second man got up and went out.
Which end is his head?
There to the left.
Have you got that?
If you know, why dont you tell?
Come let us see them.
When did you begin?
Music is a good thing.
But she saw no one?
It would seem so.
How could you let him go so far?
Why dont you want to go?
Let me know at once when you will start.
What a start that was.
You are sure of that?
We must begin again.
Only, dont look back.
We should look at this.
What did he answer?
Let me hear your story.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Ask one of those men.
They dont know their own country.
You took it.
Say good night.
Will you never learn?
And this food?
Come here, my friend.
Let us go back.
But it was very late.
He had only one night more to live.
Who did you learn that from?
Cut your hand open?
Is my father here?
Do you know where he is?
So they got out and went in.
What do you hear?
This took him some time.
By and by he got it.
What did you hear?
It is well thought of.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Good night, friend.
The children will live just the same.
Why, is it late?
You found him?
Do you hear me?
Let us start, then.
Why should this be so?
Do you have a car?
No, why should he?
At this time of my life, no.
There was no letter for me.
They are hard at it.
We might learn a thing or two.
It was very hard.
Let me hear what it is.
You should take me there one day.
No, never.
He said at last.
It was his own room.
There, do you hear?
She saw it.
How could you begin?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Who should it be?
But it is all all too late now.
Do you have the letter?
Who took him out of it?
He had two left feet.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Why do you stop here?
Here is the paper.
Let me out.
You saw him?
Good for the country.
Think of my father.
It is open?
Let me look.
But you must never tell.
What was left of him?
