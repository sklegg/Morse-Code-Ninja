There, by the wheel.
He was here a minute ago.
This voice was that of my father.
You better stay here all night.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Is that a fact?
Yes, go and find out.
Her voice was low.
He is among us.
And you can do nothing until then?
It was a warm night.
Let me see your plan.
No, nothing of the kind.
Yes, said the old man.
It was a record run.
Just let us go free.
It was cold and dark.
Yes, she could sing that.
Oh, dont ask me.
But never mind that.
Did he fall?
It was a kind of language between us.
Sit down, said the old man.
Your voice is that of a young man.
There was more to be done.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Oh let me in.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
What is power?
Are they on foot?
That is a fact.
It was a dark night.
His plan is very simple.
Oh, if men only knew.
Just go to sleep.
Yes, and no.
You are in my power.
We must be quick.
Sit down, he said.
Money is power.
Oh, of course.
It is done.
Is it certain?
Yes, of course.
And here is the note.
A fine thing too.
He must wait.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Well, of course.
Oh, go on.
Very well, wait a minute.
She heard and saw nothing.
Never mind that.
They would cry.
All right then, sit down.
You can sleep here.
You knew it, and said nothing?
You know you must say yes.
What did the letter contain?
How is that done?
Is that possible?
Yes and no.
Clear the way.
At his side was a large green box.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Nothing could have been better.
Of course she will.
But how long ago?
But let us see your plan.
It was a very dark night.
How was that possible?
He left long ago.
What is done is done.
Oh, take those off.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Here is our plan.
It must be done at once.
It is nothing.
You will fall.
The island was a mile long.
Why should my father fly?
Wait a second.
You must stay with me.
He must be in the same boat as us.
Money is no object?
Free to do what?
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Oh, that is very simple.
Laugh, if you will.
But what then must be done?
You must have a rest.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Try to sleep.
Oh, tell me.
It was brought to me.
See what you have done.
Well, what about my plan?
Stay where you are.
But it must be done soon.
Which box do you mean?
It is no use, said a voice.
Wonder if he has a name.
Answer me that, miss.
is it come yet?
Oh, no.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Oh, this is too much.
What have you done?
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Yes, we know that.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Is he in bed?
He brought it with him for us to see.
It must be done.
He stood up.
Are you strong?
Yes, it did.
Yes, that is true.
He gave me this paper.
And what have you done to me?
Behind every book is a man.
Bring them here.
How long would you keep me in town?
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Then lead the way.
It is all done.
It is certain.
Nothing could be more simple.
Yes, he said.
It is very clear.
She got her hand free.
There is no possible way.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
No, nothing at all.
Fine, very fine.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Will you rest here a little?
Keep clear of him.
Go back to bed.
Oh, he is so kind.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
And he told you nothing?
There is nothing more to be said.
Yes, it is true.
Oh, man.
Oh, come now.
It is time for bed.
Of course it might.
Decide if you are going back home.
Half the town was there.
He began to laugh.
All of this was possible.
Who brought you up?
Why did you bring him here?
That was well done.
Yes, she said.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
What more is to be done?
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
He is in the box.
And what a voice she has.
Wonder is it like that.
Go in there and drive them out.
It might have done me good.
Again came the voice.
The water ran dry.
Yes, go on.
It is a real bed.
Who gave it to you?
Then all was dark again.
Yes, very well.
Then it is certain?
You must stay.
We brought them in.
What brought you here?
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Then he must be a wonder.
In that town there is a street.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Oh, to be sure.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Lead me to him.
Come quick.
Do you see that island?
They know nothing about it.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
He knew nothing.
The old man gave no answer.
Yes, that was a picture book.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
The city was soon behind me.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Well, miss?
He had, to be sure, done much.
How was it done?
I hear his voice in the house.
Well, sit down by me.
and so he decide he go back home.
Of course it is.
Yes, she was back.
What age is he?
And yet you said he had money.
She began to cry.
What a game.
You brought no one with you?
He never said nothing.
Did she stay long?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Yes, all right.
It was so long ago.
Where can you wait for me?
If only they would be quick.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Is it possible?
Oh, but you were there?
Never mind me.
You love a certain person.
Take good note of it.
Leave the rest to me.
He saw nothing.
Wait and see.
Well, sit down.
Well, there he stood.
Bring this with you.
In a minute.
It was very dark.
You are free to do so.
My mind is made up.
Let us sit down.
Nothing is more simple.
Of course he was right.
Yes, but what did she say?
But wait a minute.
But she is nothing to me now.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
It was full of people.
The night was dark.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Hold on a minute.
My mind was soon made up.
Do you have my note?
Be back in a minute.
It was so very long ago.
Fly, my friend.
Nothing at all.
Yes, you are right.
It was hot.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Clear the table.
Better sit still.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Wait for me here, all of you.
It was done.
Did she fall?
Oh, you are there.
Now we must wait.
She gave me her hand.
It is his voice.
Let him go free?
All that for nothing?
Bring it here.
Help me sit up.
Well then, be quick.
And then the game began all over again.
That is possible.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
She was still game.
Wait for me.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
It has to be done.
Like these in shape and size?
We are more strong together.
Yes, to be sure.
But that is nothing to us.
It was a cold, dark night.
His first cry was for his father.
Dont laugh.
He has a good voice still.
Perhaps he did.
Get to bed.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
This made him wonder more and more.
Can it be possible?
Yes, he said, all of it.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
It was right in front of us.
There is a lot of people.
Nothing she can eat?
Did it all rest on me?
But they could see nothing.
They all fall to the ground.
Yes, he did.
Well yes, you are right.
But what must be done?
It stood behind the door.
Oh, nothing.
The whole day had been hot.
And yet you are the better off?
What kind of voice is it?
Do you talk in your sleep?
Look at that dark water.
What has he done?
It is possible.
Go and rest.
This is a test.
Oh, all right.
What have they done with my work?
The snow is deep.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Yes, what is it?
All was dark.
You know nothing about it.
Wonder what he does.
Come, and we can rest together.
He will sleep an hour.
He had made up his mind.
Why, of course.
What has brought you here?
Oh, do you know?
Nothing new under the sun.
Let her wait.
We are free to act and think.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
He ran up to them.
Of course they will.
Yes, but only for you and me.
You can hear that, miss?
What have they done?
Wait a minute.
Clear my name.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Well, but where can he fly to?
There is your old bed.
Oh, very well, he said.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
They call him a fine boy.
Yes, once.
Oh, do as you like.
Behind my bed.
That would be a fine thing.
Good to rest once in a way.
His will be done.
Yes, there it is.
Nothing had come of it.
Oh, take me with you.
And sit in the dark?
Yes, my love?
What can be done?
How can a little dog laugh?
Well, what does that lead up to?
Quick, friend, quick.
How long ago?
Oh, how can you sleep?
Oh, that.
Is my father in town?
Never mind how he came here.
Yes, sit down.
Oh, just listen.
Oh, do the best you can.
They need a rest.
Play the game out.
She could think of nothing more to say.
The night was very dark.
