But you must never tell.
He had only one night more to live.
Tell me more.
He then said, It is time to start.
You might want it.
It is music.
what river is it?
He had no idea how long he had been there.
It is well thought of.
How much have you got?
Come, let us be men.
Is it far?
Watch him, he said.
She came in just now by the back door.
Why, is it late?
Which story was it?
Come here, my friend.
And now let us go home.
The children will live just the same.
By and by he got it.
My father is right.
Good for the country.
And what did you do with that letter?
For once you are right.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
But they may still come here.
Dont you think so?
Where has she run off to?
We should ask him.
He had two left feet.
It was the last day of the year.
Let me have a word with you.
He has been been found.
Think of my father.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Why should this be so?
Stop and think.
It is a long story.
It would seem so.
That night we were just in time.
It was very hard.
She saw no one?
But then it will be too late.
There were few near me.
Where is this city?
Is my father here?
Let me hear what it is.
Just cut it out.
But she saw no one?
Have you got that?
Is it in the city?
Off with her head.
Tell us a story.
Here is the letter.
A second man got up and went out.
It was like new life to him.
What is your real name?
What should he say?
Let him follow me.
What a night it has been.
Let us go in.
She saw it.
Is there any answer?
What did he answer?
it took all that time to come over the water.
Have you got it?
It is always so.
We dont see it like that.
There is only food for one.
One was on a white horse.
Let us start, then.
He could run no more.
You must eat now.
Just a few.
She is my friend.
Who did you learn that from?
Stop, said he.
And there are four of you?
You must walk.
We got under way at last.
We got one and they got one.
We got to let that go.
Is he a real father?
Which end is his head?
What was the name of the man who took it?
And then they began to fish.
You got me?
There was no answer.
When did you begin?
Why, dont you hear it?
How would they stop it?
Who can answer for that?
How many are left?
Keep to the right.
Dont you want any?
Who should it be?
Let me know at once when you will start.
But what did you hear?
That is the idea.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Why should they?
We were together.
Let him answer us.
She got up.
There are only four of us.
Now you must eat.
And your children?
We must begin again.
What did he say in the letter?
Why is he cross with me?
But why dont you want to take it?
You have a car?
But take care.
Look at his face.
So it always was.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Why dont you play?
Now let me have it.
Let her go.
Open the door.
Can you hear me?
Do you hear that?
No, said her father.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Does he never go out?
You are sure of that?
Let me get to work.
It was then time to start.
Off with his head.
What do you hear?
Dont tell me.
Only, dont look back.
But watch over him.
Where is the river?
But it would be in the paper.
Take care of him.
We found it.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Are you my friend?
Ask one of those men.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
They came over last night.
Cut him down.
Any book will tell you that.
You should take me there one day.
Do you hear me?
Why, it was one of his own men.
Write an answer.
We are together.
We must go at once.
Do you know where he is?
Have you never been there?
It must be in her own house.
Well, what next?
Did you see his eye?
Say good night.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
It was his own room.
Let me in.
They are always the same.
What did you hear?
Dont you like it?
Where have you been this long while?
The sun had set long since.
There was no letter for me.
And now, good night.
Is that far?
See him grow up.
This is real.
The other night she left.
Still, you never know.
She came over last night.
They dont know their own country.
You are right, father.
Let us go back.
But are you sure of that?
No, that can never be.
A call for help, you thought?
Then, good night.
But let us walk.
What was left of him?
And who is this friend?
We might learn a thing or two.
They dont care.
Are you sure of it?
Watch over him.
Let me be and let me live.
Let them have it.
This is my country.
Always the same with you people.
Have you found it?
He may come close.
And why should they?
No, never.
Just cut it out, will you?
He is my father.
At this time of my life, no.
How could you begin?
These were the first people we saw.
Well, run back to her.
Will you never learn?
Let us cross over.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Are you sure?
Let me see it.
Here we see the boy at school.
You saw him?
And she left the room.
Tell her to begin.
So take care of me.
What do you think of the music?
What do you think when you hear music?
Who was the letter from?
To the left.
They never come back.
Who let you in?
She is still here?
Here is the book.
Who took him out of it?
Do you know what he did last night?
Keep watch all night.
Stop, let me show you the way.
Keep to the left.
First turn to the left.
Let me go back.
So, once more, good night.
Have you been at sea?
What a start that was.
That was the first night.
Good night, friend.
They are hard at it.
Few had found it.
Take care.
They never did it again.
Let me see him at once.
What was it that you thought?
He is always at it.
No, why should he?
Dont you see that?
He said at last.
Give me the letter.
How did it begin?
Do we stop here?
What is life to you?
Why dont you want to go?
Who said four?
But hard to tell.
Can you stand?
There to the left.
It was white.
She never came back.
And what did you learn from him?
We may be too late.
It is from your father.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
So he began to help.
They may tell us to open it.
Sure of what?
Never see him again.
But then you would be close to the sea?
And he left the room.
But now it is too late.
There, do you hear?
How could you let him go so far?
Music is a good thing.
He might still be up.
Let me see him.
Here is the paper.
How many children?
Cut your hand open?
Let me hear your story.
Always the same, year after year.
What would you have me do with my life?
Well, read the letter again.
Let me see her.
Let me look.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Point it at his horse.
Do you have a car?
You must never tell.
Come at once.
Call the next one.
In the country?
Where could you keep it?
You must study.
Are we late?
One never has too much.
You found him?
One of us will be here all night.
Go to your father.
Now or never.
He came at once.
This is what began it all.
We never thought of that.
But it is the same with any life.
He has children of his own.
Let me out.
They always know.
So they got out and went in.
Dont say that to me.
We are very far from that.
No, dont.
Are we too late?
No, stop.
Here he is at last.
At last we have a man.
Then let me have a word with you.
You took it.
Come eat with me.
Right here it began.
Good night again.
Do you often come back?
Who could have thought it?
Was you in my room?
You are sure of it?
She must have a hard time with him.
He saw his men draw back.
Do you know how he made his mark?
At four, she said.
Our own people must come first.
Do you want some more to eat?
And then we may begin.
It will be too late.
Come let us see them.
This took him some time.
But it was very late.
He is my friend.
Why do you stop here?
Dont move, he said.
She might be at his house.
You will answer for it.
It might help.
It is open?
But you got to play music for them.
Let me go to the door.
Life is all right.
Let him grow up with you.
We should look at this.
Who found them out?
It is so very kind of you both.
What country does he come from?
No, said the Tree.
Let me get on with my work.
Both of us.
Let me say one thing.
He is at sea.
Come over in the sun.
Do you have the letter?
And this food?
Do you want to cross?
But it is all all too late now.
