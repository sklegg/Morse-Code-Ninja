And do you like him?
What is it all about?
But will he see it?
Do you know her?
What time is it?
There he is, she said.
How can you know?
At what number?
What are you up to?
When was it?
Which is it?
What is that?
What do they call you?
You know more than we do.
What do you see?
Look at it this way.
He said no.
There you are.
And what did you see?
What is he like?
Would you like some?
We have no water.
But what will you do?
are you there?
But what have they been up to?
Who will go first?
Now you know.
What is there to see?
There is but one thing to do.
Did you see it?
How are you?
And what do you make of it?
You can go.
But it has been so long.
What is it for?
but there was more to it than this.
Now what are we to do with you?
How did he do it?
What was it?
What did they do?
So be it.
So it is.
Had to look the other way.
Do as you like.
But WHAT DID you see?
Are you there?
What would she have said?
And what was it for?
Now there is no more to be said.
And all for what?
But so it is.
We have him.
But he had to have it.
She has it.
And is that all?
Then make it up.
but we can go and see.
How did you come by it?
How did she do it?
Do you know him?
who can it be?
You have them?
Then, how do you know?
But what are you up to?
And how did you find out?
what is it?
How can it be?
But how is that?
But what is it?
Out of the way.
How long has he been there?
May we come in?
What are we to do?
And could she see him?
Has it come to this?
And has it come to this?
Did you know her?
What is it about?
When was that?
Is it like him?
Is that all?
How would you like to have it?
That is what she did.
Then there is more to do.
So that was the way.
That was it.
But when will that be?
How was that?
No was there one?
What can we do, then?
Who was he?
And do you like her?
Did you see her?
Look at it.
But he had no time.
How is he?
But who was she?
Go on, he said.
The time will come.
At what time?
who, then, are you?
And what is that?
How do you do?
Do you know?
But it was of no use.
Look over it.
There they are.
The time had come.
and so on, and so on.
That was all she said.
Will that do?
There were two of them.
There he is, do you see him?
Who is she?
What is all this?
So there it was.
What do you make of it?
And what do you call her?
Is that it?
Can one see from there?
You know how it is with her.
And who is this?
Did you know him?
Then what is it?
But how about you?
Do you see it?
There he is, you see.
Is she like him?
That is a long time.
What will you do, then?
Did you know them?
Tqhen you may go.
Call him in.
Now is your time.
Can you do that?
Would you do what he did?
You can have some.
Who was that?
So it was.
What have you come for?
How is he now?
You can do it.
Do you see him?
Look at him.
What do you make of that?
Come this way.
Who are you?
You may go.
Then who are you?
And when will you call?
What can this be?
What did he do to you?
Then what are you up to now?
but what if it is?
Who and what are you?
They said no more.
And who are you?
what has she to do with it?
That will do, said he.
There you are, he said.
Do they know him?
Will you come and see her?
Then how many are there?
What did you do then?
And what did you do then?
That will do, he said.
Is it time?
Is that her?
It was from you.
What could it be?
Do you know what you look like?
What DO you know of him?
What is it like?
Look at them.
Do you know what it is?
How did you know about it?
What was it about?
Can it be?
Do you like him?
No one will come, she said.
When is it?
Is it over?
How is she?
What was he like?
Do as you will.
And who was that?
You have it.
One or two?
Or so they said.
Is he there?
What other way is there to look at it?
So there it was.
Then what is it?
How long has he been there?
And has it come to this?
Had to look the other way.
How are you?
There you are.
There is but one thing to do.
But it has been so long.
May we come in?
But what is it?
At what number?
Go on, he said.
What have you come for?
But he had to have it.
So that was the way.
When was that?
What do you make of that?
Would you like some?
And is that all?
what is it?
Is that all?
Did you know her?
And what did you see?
How do you do?
Has it come to this?
And when will you call?
There they are.
Is she like him?
How is he now?
You know how it is with her.
But WHAT DID you see?
And all for what?
Is it time?
Did you see it?
You can go.
what has she to do with it?
Call him in.
But who was she?
That will do, he said.
Do you know him?
And what do you call her?
How did you come by it?
What other way is there to look at it?
And what did you do then?
What is it like?
Did you see her?
What is there to see?
What could it be?
Do you know?
What would she have said?
Do you see him?
And could she see him?
But will he see it?
Do as you like.
You know more than we do.
who can it be?
How can it be?
That was it.
What was it about?
It was from you.
What is it for?
Do you know what it is?
We have no water.
How would you like to have it?
Can you do that?
What are you up to?
Then what are you up to now?
How did you know about it?
What do you make of it?
Will you come and see her?
but what if it is?
Will that do?
What is he like?
Tqhen you may go.
And who is this?
Do they know him?
There were two of them.
Do you know her?
Who and what are you?
At what time?
Now you know.
But how is that?
How can you know?
What DO you know of him?
That was all she said.
The time had come.
And who was that?
Now is your time.
Then make it up.
But when will that be?
are you there?
What do you see?
There you are, he said.
Do you see it?
So it was.
Who will go first?
But what will you do?
Is it over?

Are you there?
That will do, said he.
Out of the way.
