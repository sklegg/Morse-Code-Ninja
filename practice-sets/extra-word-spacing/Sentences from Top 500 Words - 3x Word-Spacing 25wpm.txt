It was brought to me.
Half the town was there.
Did she stay long?
Keep clear of him.
What is power?
Let me see your plan.
He was here a minute ago.
Yes, and no.
In a minute.
In that town there is a street.
And then the game began all over again.
His plan is very simple.
Oh let me in.
Oh, nothing.
Is my father in town?
You will fall.
Oh, that is very simple.
It has to be done.
Again came the voice.
At his side was a large green box.
You can sleep here.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Behind my bed.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Very well, wait a minute.
Quick, friend, quick.
Answer me that, miss.
What did the letter contain?
Yes, she said.
They all fall to the ground.
That would be a fine thing.
There is no one in that room behind you.
It was full of people.
Well, miss?
Wait a second.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
How was that possible?
The little boy lay in his bed.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
You love a certain person.
Let us sit down.
Yes, of course.
And what a voice she has.
Oh, do the best you can.
He ran up to them.
What brought you here?
What a game.
It was a warm night.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
She began to cry.
It was a very dark night.
Nothing new under the sun.
Who brought you up?
It was cold and dark.
Sit down, he said.
and so he decide he go back home.
There was more to be done.
Oh, to be sure.
Look at that dark water.
He began to laugh.
He saw nothing.
How long ago?
He never said nothing.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Help me sit up.
Yes, once.
Go and rest.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Why, of course.
Yes and no.
I hear his voice in the house.
Nothing is more simple.
Well, sit down.
Can it be possible?
My mind was soon made up.
Yes, it did.
How long would you keep me in town?
Of course he was right.
Yes, go and find out.
She gave me her hand.
The night was very dark.
We are free to act and think.
And what have you done to me?
His first cry was for his father.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Oh, dont ask me.
Oh, do as you like.
Lead me to him.
You must stay with me.
But how long ago?
Come, and we can rest together.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Just let us go free.
Yes, he did.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Good to rest once in a way.
The whole day had been hot.
Be back in a minute.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Is it certain?
No, nothing at all.
Money is power.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
He is among us.
Oh, he is so kind.
That was well done.
We must be quick.
It is possible.
It is time for bed.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Yes, my love?
You brought no one with you?
Now we must wait.
Yes, but what did she say?
Will you rest here a little?
Of course they will.
He is in the box.
Wait and see.
Oh, if men only knew.
The water ran dry.
Yes, sit down.
Behind every book is a man.
Money is no object?
Oh, come now.
Free to do what?
There is nothing more to be said.
Nothing she can eat?
What can be done?
It is certain.
He had made up his mind.
What have they done?
Did she fall?
It is his voice.
Just go to sleep.
Do you have my note?
And yet you said he had money.
Yes, what is it?
Of course she will.
It was done.
All that for nothing?
There, by the wheel.
Wonder what he does.
Is that possible?
Why should my father fly?
You are in my power.
What has he done?
Like these in shape and size?
Oh, just listen.
Laugh, if you will.
Wonder is it like that.
It is nothing.
Wait for me here, all of you.
They call him a fine boy.
But what then must be done?
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Yes, but only for you and me.
It was right in front of us.
Yes, said the old man.
We brought them in.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Yes, she was back.
There is your old bed.
What age is he?
It was very dark.
She heard and saw nothing.
Then it is certain?
Play the game out.
That is possible.
But it must be done soon.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
A fine thing too.
Nothing at all.
Then he must be a wonder.
He left long ago.
Did he fall?
Clear the way.
It is a real bed.
What more is to be done?
Yes, all right.
Yes, that is true.
It was a kind of language between us.
Bring it here.
Yes, very well.
Yes, we know that.
Where can you wait for me?
It was a cold, dark night.
Nothing had come of it.
Did it all rest on me?
Oh, of course.
Yes, go on.
Decide if you are going back home.
But what must be done?
It was a record run.
But never mind that.
Nothing could have been better.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Which box do you mean?
Fly, my friend.
What is done is done.
Then lead the way.
It was hot.
Who gave it to you?
And sit in the dark?
Oh, take me with you.
There is no possible way.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Well, sit down by me.
The night was dark.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Leave the rest to me.
You know you must say yes.
The city was soon behind me.
That is a fact.
Bring them here.
It is very clear.
Well, of course.
It was a dark night.
Wait a minute.
It stood behind the door.
The old man gave no answer.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
It might have done me good.
But they could see nothing.
Well then, be quick.
Yes, he said.
This voice was that of my father.
Oh, no.
No, nothing of the kind.
Oh, tell me.
What have they done with my work?
Clear the table.
But wait a minute.
They know nothing about it.
If only they would be quick.
It is no use, said a voice.
Is that a fact?
Of course it might.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Yes, she could sing that.
Oh, very well, he said.
Your voice is that of a young man.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Why did you bring him here?
They would cry.
Well, there he stood.
Let him go free?
In her name, then, let it be done.
The island was a mile long.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Bring this with you.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Yes, he said, all of it.
All right then, sit down.
But let us see your plan.
Dont laugh.
The whole night the tree stood still.
What have you done?
See what you have done.
Is he in bed?
Yes, that was a picture book.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
What kind of voice is it?
Yes, there it is.
Do you see that island?
And you can do nothing until then?
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Why does the boat go so fast?
How was it done?
Oh, you are there.
Get to bed.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Fine, very fine.
Oh, all right.
There is a lot of people.
Sit down, said the old man.
Better sit still.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
He knew nothing.
Try to sleep.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Her voice was low.
Are they on foot?
He has a good voice still.
It was so long ago.
Yes, you are right.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Never mind me.
Oh, man.
They need a rest.
Well yes, you are right.
And he told you nothing?
She could think of nothing more to say.
You better stay here all night.
Wait for me.
He must be in the same boat as us.
How can a little dog laugh?
Well, what does that lead up to?
Then all was dark again.
is it come yet?
It must be done.
Clear my name.
Go in there and drive them out.
Are you strong?
His will be done.
It is all done.
Oh, do you know?
All was dark.
Hold on a minute.
Of course it is.
The snow is deep.
We are more strong together.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
He will sleep an hour.
He must wait.
Is it possible?
Oh, that.
You know nothing about it.
All of this was possible.
You must stay.
Nothing could be more simple.
Come quick.
But that is nothing to us.
Well, what about my plan?
My mind is made up.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Go back to bed.
You are free to do so.
Here is our plan.
Oh, take those off.
She got her hand free.
Never mind how he came here.
What has brought you here?
You knew it, and said nothing?
Perhaps he did.
Take good note of it.
Oh, go on.
Do you talk in your sleep?
You can hear that, miss?
Never mind that.
Oh, but you were there?
Yes, to be sure.
Let her wait.
This made him wonder more and more.
It is done.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Wonder if he has a name.
She was still game.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
And yet you are the better off?
And here is the note.
Yes, it is true.
It was so very long ago.
Stay where you are.
He gave me this paper.
But she is nothing to me now.
He stood up.
This is a test.
It must be done at once.
You must have a rest.
Oh, this is too much.
How is that done?
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
