She heard and saw nothing.
The island was a mile long.
Sit down, said the old man.
Yes, it did.
Oh, man.
Did she stay long?
The city was soon behind me.
All that for nothing?
Yes, but only for you and me.
But wait a minute.
How was that possible?
He knew nothing.
Wonder is it like that.
They know nothing about it.
Perhaps he did.
How long would you keep me in town?
Who brought you up?
Why does the boat go so fast?
All was dark.
Oh, but you were there?
Oh, this is too much.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
How is that done?
It must be done.
Yes, go on.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
It was a cold, dark night.
He is among us.
Wonder what he does.
Are they on foot?
Is that a fact?
He left long ago.
Again came the voice.
Nothing she can eat?
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
She began to cry.
What is done is done.
Oh let me in.
It was cold and dark.
How long ago?
Well, sit down.
Wait a second.
Yes, once.
Dont laugh.
He began to laugh.
Yes, my love?
Sit down, he said.
Why should my father fly?
Yes, all right.
There, by the wheel.
Oh, to be sure.
Be back in a minute.
Well, miss?
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
That is possible.
Why, of course.
And then the game began all over again.
He has a good voice still.
is it come yet?
What brought you here?
It was very dark.
And here is the note.
He stood up.
But what then must be done?
Oh, no.
No, nothing of the kind.
It has to be done.
Wait for me.
Decide if you are going back home.
But she is nothing to me now.
Well yes, you are right.
You are in my power.
It was full of people.
Money is power.
It might have done me good.
What has he done?
You brought no one with you?
Then he must be a wonder.
You must stay.
The night was very dark.
Nothing new under the sun.
Nothing is more simple.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Hold on a minute.
Yes, what is it?
We are more strong together.
Let her wait.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
She was still game.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
It was so very long ago.
Oh, that.
Let him go free?
Yes, said the old man.
Do you see that island?
There is no possible way.
In that town there is a street.
It is all done.
Play the game out.
Behind every book is a man.
Yes, sit down.
What is power?
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
You can sleep here.
Good to rest once in a way.
Lead me to him.
It is no use, said a voice.
Laugh, if you will.
What has brought you here?
Clear the table.
Wonder if he has a name.
Do you have my note?
This voice was that of my father.
Yes, she could sing that.
Oh, he is so kind.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
But they could see nothing.
You must stay with me.
The whole night the tree stood still.
And sit in the dark?
He never said nothing.
He gave me this paper.
It was a warm night.
It is certain.
Just go to sleep.
People might know my voice and find me out.
And he told you nothing?
Money is no object?
Oh, very well, he said.
There is nothing more to be said.
Nothing could have been better.
What have they done with my work?
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Oh, tell me.
Of course he was right.
Get to bed.
Yes, of course.
Your voice is that of a young man.
In a minute.
Just let us go free.
All right then, sit down.
They would cry.
That was well done.
They call him a fine boy.
It was a kind of language between us.
He saw nothing.
This made him wonder more and more.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Look at that dark water.
Are you strong?
It stood behind the door.
Oh, that is very simple.
My mind is made up.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Help me sit up.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Of course they will.
It was a record run.
They need a rest.
Go back to bed.
What age is he?
Yes, go and find out.
That would be a fine thing.
Oh, come now.
Behind my bed.
My mind was soon made up.
But it must be done soon.
Yes, that is true.
It is very clear.
You knew it, and said nothing?
And you can do nothing until then?
Bring this with you.
Wait a minute.
Yes, he said, all of it.
It is possible.
What can be done?
Then bring them to me, she said.
Is my father in town?
Bring it here.
Very well, wait a minute.
Come quick.
All of this was possible.
What a game.
Like these in shape and size?
It was right in front of us.
The old man gave no answer.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Yes, very well.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Yes, it is true.
It is done.
Wait for me here, all of you.
But how long ago?
How can a little dog laugh?
And yet you are the better off?
What have you done?
Never mind that.
It is his voice.
There is a lot of people.
Nothing at all.
And what a voice she has.
But what must be done?
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
You better stay here all night.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Where can you wait for me?
He is in the box.
He had made up his mind.
She got her hand free.
I hear his voice in the house.
You know you must say yes.
We are free to act and think.
Go and rest.
His first cry was for his father.
Nothing had come of it.
Then it is certain?
But let us see your plan.
Wait and see.
He brought it with him for us to see.
And yet you said he had money.
Let us sit down.
Did he fall?
How was it done?
Yes, but what did she say?
Oh, nothing.
Oh, do the best you can.
Yes, she said.
Oh, go on.
It was brought to me.
It was done.
This is a test.
His plan is very simple.
Well, there he stood.
Who gave it to you?
Of course it might.
Well, what about my plan?
Of course she will.
He was here a minute ago.
Half the town was there.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
The night was dark.
Go in there and drive them out.
Yes, he said.
Oh, dont ask me.
It was a very dark night.
Oh, just listen.
Oh, you are there.
Her voice was low.
You know nothing about it.
Oh, how can you sleep?
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Is that possible?
Oh, of course.
Do you talk in your sleep?
The little boy lay in his bed.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Keep clear of him.
Try to sleep.
What kind of voice is it?
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Leave the rest to me.
It was a dark night.
But that is nothing to us.
His will be done.
Well, of course.
Free to do what?
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Yes, he did.
A fine thing too.
See what you have done.
They all fall to the ground.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Answer me that, miss.
Oh, take those off.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
But never mind that.
Yes, you are right.
You are free to do so.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Is it possible?
It was so long ago.
He had, to be sure, done much.
and so he decide he go back home.
Oh, do as you like.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
He must wait.
If only they would be quick.
Did it all rest on me?
You love a certain person.
What did the letter contain?
It was hot.
Which box do you mean?
Yes and no.
Oh, all right.
What more is to be done?
It is nothing.
Fly, my friend.
It is a real bed.
Then all was dark again.
She gave me her hand.
You can hear that, miss?
It is time for bed.
And what have you done to me?
Come, and we can rest together.
Quick, friend, quick.
Of course it is.
At his side was a large green box.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Did she fall?
Fine, very fine.
Take good note of it.
We brought them in.
Never mind me.
That is a fact.
Why did you bring him here?
Then lead the way.
Better sit still.
Bring them here.
Now we must wait.
Never mind how he came here.
Is it certain?
In her name, then, let it be done.
Oh, take me with you.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Yes, and no.
Well then, be quick.
Yes, she was back.
He will sleep an hour.
The whole day had been hot.
There is your old bed.
He ran up to them.
Clear the way.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Clear my name.
The snow is deep.
Well, what does that lead up to?
It must be done at once.
Nothing could be more simple.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Let me see your plan.
You must have a rest.
Stay where you are.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Yes, we know that.
There was more to be done.
Can it be possible?
He must be in the same boat as us.
We must be quick.
Here is our plan.
Yes, there it is.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Be quick, for the time is short.
You will fall.
Is he in bed?
Oh, if men only knew.
No, nothing at all.
What have they done?
She could think of nothing more to say.
Oh, do you know?
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
The water ran dry.
Will you rest here a little?
Yes, to be sure.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Well, sit down by me.
