How is she?
What do you make of it?
Now is your time.
What is that?
So it is.
And what do you call her?
But he had to have it.
Did you see it?
There you are.
but what if it is?
You know more than we do.
Who was that?
Then how many are there?
You have it.
Can you do that?
But what have they been up to?
And what was it for?
What did he do to you?
Is he there?
Are you there?
And is that all?
What will you do, then?
Now what are we to do with you?
Would you do what he did?
Is that all?
What is it all about?
It was from you.
One or two?
And all for what?
And do you like him?
What is there to see?
Do you know what it is?
Or so they said.
How did he do it?
That was it.
What have you come for?
but we can go and see.
When was that?
And what is that?
There were two of them.
There is but one thing to do.
What DO you know of him?
What did you do then?
But who was she?
But he had no time.
What is he like?
That will do, he said.
The time will come.
But what are you up to?
And how did you find out?
Would you like some?
But when will that be?
What did they do?
You can go.
Did you know them?
Then make it up.
Do you know what you look like?
Look at it this way.
You have them?
And what did you do then?
And could she see him?
And what did you see?
what is it?
What was he like?
Had to look the other way.
Can it be?
Who are you?
Then what are you up to now?
And who was that?
Who will go first?
and so on, and so on.
That will do, said he.
So that was the way.
Look at him.
Which is it?
But will he see it?
That is a long time.
But how is that?
Is it time?
How long has he been there?
And do you like her?
There he is, do you see him?
We have no water.
Do you know?
Who was he?
Can one see from there?
Do as you like.
Do you know her?
You can do it.
What do you see?
At what time?
but there was more to it than this.
How was that?
Out of the way.
What is it for?
Do you like him?
Do you know him?
Do they know him?
And when will you call?
What was it?
And what do you make of it?
He said no.
Now there is no more to be said.
What would she have said?
Did you know him?
When was it?
So there it was.
Then what is it?
Do as you will.
Is that her?
are you there?
No one will come, she said.
So it was.
Look over it.
And has it come to this?
How did she do it?
Is it over?
But it was of no use.
What is it like?
Tqhen you may go.
what has she to do with it?
Did you know her?
When is it?
Go on, he said.
Do you see him?
Who and what are you?
There they are.
She has it.
Will you come and see her?
But how about you?
Now you know.
There he is, she said.
There he is, you see.
How would you like to have it?
Is that it?
There you are, he said.
They said no more.
But what is it?
What can we do, then?
What other way is there to look at it?
You can have some.
How is he now?
What can this be?
Is it like him?
Will that do?
That was all she said.
How can it be?
How did you come by it?
Come this way.
Did you see her?
What are we to do?
who, then, are you?
You may go.
Who is she?
Look at it.
Do you see it?
Has it come to this?
But it has been so long.
What was it about?
The time had come.
But what will you do?
What do they call you?
But WHAT DID you see?
How can you know?
How did you know about it?
Call him in.
And who is this?
Then, how do you know?
What is it about?
How do you do?
No was there one?
Look at them.
What is all this?
That is what she did.
who can it be?
And who are you?
We have him.
How are you?
What could it be?
You know how it is with her.
What are you up to?
What time is it?
Then who are you?
But so it is.
Then there is more to do.
Is she like him?
So be it.
May we come in?
How is he?
At what number?
What do you make of that?
There were two of them.
Has it come to this?
Who was he?
Then, how do you know?
And has it come to this?
Had to look the other way.
But how is that?
Did you know him?
who can it be?
What is it for?
Now what are we to do with you?
What will you do, then?
but we can go and see.
You have them?
Will that do?
But so it is.
Then make it up.
Is she like him?
Do you see it?
Do you like him?
You can have some.
No was there one?
But he had to have it.
Did you see her?
What is there to see?
One or two?
Then how many are there?
How did you know about it?
But what is it?
How would you like to have it?
But what will you do?
Would you like some?
But it has been so long.
At what number?
And do you like her?
Is it like him?
There they are.
who, then, are you?
It was from you.
How was that?
Now you know.
but there was more to it than this.
And do you like him?
Do as you like.
Do you know?
But how about you?
what has she to do with it?
Who is she?
You may go.
What is that?
Will you come and see her?
There he is, do you see him?
And all for what?
She has it.
Call him in.
Can it be?
And is that all?
Then what is it?
So there it was.
What would she have said?
What could it be?
At what time?
Who was that?
And what do you call her?
Tqhen you may go.
We have no water.

Do you see him?
How is she?
What do you make of that?
What DO you know of him?
How long has he been there?
What is it all about?
and so on, and so on.
Look at him.
There is but one thing to do.
Is he there?
Do you know what you look like?
There you are.
But what are you up to?
There he is, she said.
What time is it?
What did they do?
And what is that?
And could she see him?
The time had come.
Go on, he said.
Is it time?
How is he?
And what did you do then?
That will do, he said.
Did you see it?
How did she do it?
And who are you?
We have him.
That is a long time.
How can you know?
And what do you make of it?
So that was the way.
What was it about?
How are you?
Are you there?
What was he like?
Is that her?
Who and what are you?
What have you come for?
But it was of no use.
But he had no time.
Then there is more to do.
What do you see?
Do you know him?
What other way is there to look at it?
There you are, he said.
What do they call you?
Now is your time.
But what have they been up to?
No one will come, she said.
That will do, said he.
They said no more.
What was it?
And what did you see?
And who was that?
How do you do?
Look at it this way.
How can it be?
And who is this?
What do you make of it?
But who was she?

Do as you will.
What is it like?
And when will you call?
You know more than we do.
Do they know him?
That was all she said.
Then who are you?
Or so they said.
So it was.
What can we do, then?
Out of the way.
But when will that be?
Would you do what he did?

What is it about?
You have it.
Look at it.
Is that all?

Now there is no more to be said.
What did he do to you?
Look at them.
Look over it.
Who will go first?
Do you know her?
That is what she did.
Did you know them?
You know how it is with her.
And how did you find out?
Can you do that?
You can go.
Who are you?
Come this way.
So it is.
Then what are you up to now?
