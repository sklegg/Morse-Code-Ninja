Well then, tell him so.
Where are we to turn for help?
How can you tell?
Move on, then.
And it did me good.
Is that all you want?
Where could he be?
All right, then.
And who is the man?
What a good thing it would be.
But he does so need a mother.
What do you play?
Now, you know me.
All in good time.
You think so, too?
Do you know me?
No, tell me.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
He was at work again.
Give me my work.
That is right, said the old man.
What does it all mean?
What will each of you give?
And what will they do with us?
She has been with him many long years.
What have you been after?
And a very good thing, too.
Is he big?
Where in the world did you come from?
There she is again.
You can help me here.
Can you take me?
How could she say such a thing.
We must come back.
Well, and is that all?
How long have you been here?
Take some, she said.
Is it all right?
And what did he say?
There was no one near.
What on earth do you mean?
That would be very good.
How old was she?
Then what kind is it?
But why do you ask?
Where does he live?
Think it over.
He said that that would help.
Go and try.
You know, you see right through people.
Follow me, said the man.
Ask her, he said.
Get to work.
Think of him.
Why are you like this?
Why are you here?
To what end?
Just look through it.
But where is he?
It is very kind of you.
He was there too.
They want more.
And what was his name?
Well then, what do you want?
Good, he said.
Is she well?
And how in the world did you find them?
Take this and this.
And what did she say?
this one, too?
Here it is.
But this is the point.
How does she use you?
And they went home.
He is at my house.
Too much in the way.
It is all the same.
Is that right?
This is my point.
The world is before you.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
You are most kind.
Give me your hand.
For how much?
But who was your mother?
There was work to do.
Would you now like to look round my place?
Been back long?
Time to get out.
Much good that would be.
Turn this way.
Is it you or me?
Is there some for me?
I would like to see her again in that.
Think what you will.
Do you think so?
What is in your hand?
Too much of this.
Where are we?
What do you think of this?
Well, did he?
How did you get me out?
In what year?
They had all been very good to us.
He said too much.
What did you say that for?
You must come now.
take them all.
Tell me about it.
And where is he now?
Where are you from?
Too much for me now.
Is it as good now?
Get out and play.
But what about me?
Look at it other way round.
Is it large?
What do you think of him?
What will you say?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Say no more about it.
Is it any good?
Very well, he said.
Good day, one and all.
Why do you want to know?
Large or small?
You are all very kind to me.
How did you get here?
But where are we to go?
What do you want to ask these people?
What did he say?
Tell me all about it.
Read that, he said.
Were you here before me?
There, that does me good.
Well, what do you think?
If you want to know, go and find out.
How old are you?
Why is that?
Very well, show him to me.
It will take a little time.
She had to tell him.
Why, what is it, then?
Can you point it out to me?
This is the first act.
Who is that man?
Where are you off to?
It was high time.
Where is she?
What on earth does this mean?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
How can you think of such a thing?
What do you mean by that?
But he is right.
You will get on in the world.
And have you been here long?
Where have they been?
Come and help me.
What could set you off in the first place?
How much are they?
And what are they made of?
How can you say that?
Now, what do you want with me?
Do you want me to do it?
Now, go home.
What you have just said is good, very good.
We are who we say we are.
Play with them.
Is he a good man?
Who are these men?
Get out of the way.
Why do you want water?
And why is that?
What does he mean?
Are you back again?
Come with me to the little house.
Give it me.
Do you think so now?
Tell me who made the world.
Very well then.
For some man.
You see it every day.
Try it on.
That is all one can say about her.
And in she went.
Here she is.
Now tell me.
And that was the end of it.
She went on.
What is that in your hand?
Well, go on.
What more could a man ask for?
What do you mean?
After three, he said.
Come with me.
What does one live for?
Where is he now?
Where did he come from?
What was it you said to me?
Where have you been?
She was right.
Will you come with me?
What do you want me to do?
Will you try?
What do you want?
You must tell me.
Hand it in.
When will her mother come?
See, they are here.
He has more to give.
But why do you ask me?
Give me more than that
Look at me.
Where to, now?
How on earth do you know?
You think so?
Then why are you here?
Just look at her.
Ask him to show up?
do you come from the end of the world?
Well, how did it go?
When will it take place?
Where are they off to now?
In what part of the house?
Well, what do you think about it?
How do you take it?
That was a house to look at.
It is the same thing.
Did you tell him?
This is the man.
And where is she, then?
He will ask for it.
What did you say your name was?
He will live.
That was a good time.
This for me?
Now come here.
Do you think she was?
Where is he?
Now it was time to act.
There is no one here to see.
But what did you want?
Well, and what do you think?
And off we go.
She came up to them.
And where is this man?
You can say what it is.
Do it for me.
Here is the way we put in the time.
No, mother.
The first act was over.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
At your house?
Which house is it?
What do you think of her?
Come with me, then.
What would you have me do?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Give me a light.
How much do you want?
What does she think about me?
He was so kind.
Only two there now.
Can you help me find my way?
What does all this mean?
Why is he here?
Well, tell me.
And where was the place?
Who will tell her?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
You are right.
Say what you want.
See, here it is.
And where is it?
But where is it?
It was now his turn to look about him.
But what does it mean?
And how did you find out?
How did that help you?
Will you take me to her?
Three, he said.
You must take me with you.
He went on his way.
They are here.
That was very good.
Where are you?
It would be very kind of you.
Then will come our time.
Read that, she said.
Have you been here long?
Tell us your name.
There is more to tell.
That is just my point.
Where did you place it?
It is very high.
He went to him.
What did he tell you?
Here it is, he said.
And do you know why?
Well, here he is.
What is your name?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Are they like each other?
That is the end of her.
Is this the man?
Give it to me, then.
You were near him.
What is his name?
Is there no one who can help me?
Good day to you.
And how old were you at that time?
Here is my hand.
Now where did they come from?
But you must.
Call me what you will, he said.
Why did he come?
Think no more about that.
What do you think of that?
There is no place like home.
Show me the way.
there are only two.
where did she come from?
Then they will follow you?
She was the cause of it all.
Where do they get that?
It must be where you put it.
And what about your mother?
Show me the way he went.
Why, what do you mean?
There is the little boy.
Say no more.
Just like me.
Are you at it again?
It is great.
One, two, three.
How can you find out?
When will he come back?
He was here.
That is right.
We will say no more about it, then.
Tell me his name.
Show it to me.
Tell us all about it.
Why are they here?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
What do they want?
There will just be time.
What was his name?
Are you here for good?
How does he use it?
Put it on.
Give him air.
Where do you live?
Well, all right.
What does she want?
Such as what?
What could she mean by it?
Now we see the light.
Well, how are you?
But it is just so with the world.
She has a house?
What do they say was the cause?
You are a good boy.
We are here.
Some day you may ask me about it.
And what do you think?
Well, read it.
And what is her name?
