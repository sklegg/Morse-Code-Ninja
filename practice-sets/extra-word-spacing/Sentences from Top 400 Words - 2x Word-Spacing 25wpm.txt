Hold her hand.
Take good care of the little girl.
You know me well enough.
The dog is always with him.
In short, take me.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Half a mile?
Is that true?
How did this happen?
Read them, said the King.
They left in the morning.
The night was cold.
The family was at home.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
He said, get him out of the road.
Better late than never.
Do you remember me?
How do you feel now?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
you must step out.
You saw the person?
Then you will know me better.
How does it feel?
Are we ready?
What a question.
That must be true.
He put his hand over part of the map.
He has money.
Can she sing?
Do you love me?
And how did he make his money?
Why talk to me?
It was true.
We serve them.
It will interest you, said he.
Will you answer that question?
Against what side?
Did you tell him your whole story?
And you will always love him?
Little girl, where have you been?
That is enough.
You will soon know.
Pull together.
Young man, you will go far.
Now listen to me.
That is enough for me.
He said, the work is now complete.
Are you here on leave?
Have you a family?
We took our leave early, and left together.
Ask them to sing one more song.
Does he love you?
It would be better if you went to the war.
There are four hundred?
We will talk about that.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
He had my love.
Are they made to order?
He had enough of it.
To know her is to love her.
Have you heard from him often?
And dont talk to me.
Where are you off to so early?
you know better than that.
Can you sing?
Are you all ready?
But what did we ever get for it?
Why do they want to make her sing?
How soon will he be here?
Better write it here.
If you know it, that is enough.
We were up early.
And that is the whole point.
Why did it happen?
She had very little notice from him.
And so they began to talk.
This is my body.
She told me to ask you.
Keep in step.
Long and the short of it.
It is true.
He is very simple.
Leave me out of the question.
So do you, my love.
Did you get any money?
Well, are you ready?
He never heard.
This money was for her.
Well, young man?
Before you leave, tell us.
And you are still so young.
Never heard of him.
Who was it told me his name?
You are in love with me?
No, he is a man about my size.
Let us leave them, she said.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
You are better than that.
As soon as you left, it began.
We dont know enough.
A house is on fire?
Are you ready?
An example would be better.
Who told you that?
It can never happen.
When do you leave?
What size do you want?
What can happen?
Remember that time?
Then what would happen?
You have an hour.
Hold it up to the light.
She was only a little girl.
This is simple.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
He got it this morning.
Listen to them, he said.
Better cross here.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Why do you serve?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
She is much better.
Your watch is slow.
And serve them right.
who told you you could?
Let me also ask you a question.
So the question was, what to do?
Where he was, no one knew.
you should know her better than me.
Listen to me.
You are a good girl.
Five young children.
Never heard of it before.
Pull it more to your side.
You can pass through the door.
That is true.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
What have you heard?
Then get ready at once.
Now, listen.
You are cold.
But listen to me.
Do you remember?
She is the first person in this house.
That was the rule, she said.
They knew it.
Half as many is too much.
This was true.
They told me to.
I have no children to love me.
Look to the west.
She is very plain.
But one day you must feel it.
One other question, said he.
There was no wind.
If you only knew.
Let us pass.
Do you want any money?
How do you feel?
Why do we love?
Do you know that old lay?
How many children did he leave?
Leave off that.
It is a young girl.
A better man than you.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
About the usual time.
It was cold.
It is a fire.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Let me see him, said the young man.
No, my love.
It is cold.
Did he though?
Pass this way, then.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
He knew them.
He is better than any of you.
Light my fire.
Made me feel so young.
You must leave that to me.
what could be better?
But he never heard me.
How far from the body?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
The world is big enough.
And what does she want the money for?
She was a good girl.
Are you better?
Is it true?
Do you remember him?
Who told you so?
Long live the king.
We got her half way.
Are you ready to play?
They can have all our half of the house.
You may leave the room.
Is your family well?
We must make the best of it.
That is very simple.
Every word you said was heard.
That would be the best way.
Where did they get the money from?
In an hour?
So we came down this road.
Let this man pass.
Are you in love with her?
No more money?
Feel better then.
Did they ever go back?
You have your whole life before you, she said.
You may go, said the King.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
What is there to talk about?
What does he feel?
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Are you still cold?
That was the question.
On fire, on fire.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
That may be true.
And will you direct us?
What have you against me now?
They had several children.
Do you own a dog?
You are right, my love.
Ten will be early enough.
When did this happen?
We call it black.
It was true to life.
What will happen to us?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
We had a list.
He will leave me.
You love him?
Try it on the dog first.
It has been there ever since.
Let that pass.
She knew at once.
Which king?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
How short his time.
They had heard all that before.
But why must you leave me so soon?
You were told.
She is fast?
Let me hear from you soon.
But listen to this, he said.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
You had better go.
You will always love him?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
And then he told all he knew.
They had much to talk about.
What kind of a bird?
You must travel.
This will pass in no time.
She was so young, too.
Fire and water, earth and air.
A young man?
What do you mean by that question?
They all heard me.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Had you heard?
Was he young or old?
Let me remember what he said.
Put down three and carry five.
The rock was very small.
Has she any family?
How could that happen?
She told me all about it.
We had better go in.
From then on it was war between them.
It is the rule.
Have you heard?
Let us talk about you.
You are right, young man.
An hour and a half.
Listen to this, will you?
How does this happen?
He never told us what it was she said.
Ten, did you say?
Answer me this one question.
She knew what was good for children.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
What is love?
But enough of this.
What will happen now?
The King Went to him.
It was all she could do to hold in.
You remember the place, my father?
It was a round table.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
They are still young.
Take notice.
And you can sing?
We knew them both.
It would have been more simple.
It is a rock.
Take a hold of it.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Listen to him.
But how simple it is.
What a state he was in.
Does she go fast?
Is the wind north or south?
The night was cold and still.
But let that pass.
Never heard of it.
Have you told her?
Much of it was true.
She must be told.
Is your man white or black?
No less, no more.
And so they knew that it was true.
Your true father?
Can it be true?
Leave any for him?
We are ready.
Had they been heard?
But she is very young.
You are on a ship?
Do you love her much?
Let us talk a little about my father.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
And why do you serve?
