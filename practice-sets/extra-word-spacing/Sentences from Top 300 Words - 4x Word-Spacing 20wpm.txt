No, said her father.
No, that can never be.
Where has she run off to?
She came in just now by the back door.
To the left.
Do we stop here?
Come eat with me.
Why should they?
She saw it.
Cut him down.
Here is the book.
There, do you hear?
What do you think of the music?
It was the last day of the year.
Let me have a word with you.
Now let me have it.
Never see him again.
We may be too late.
He is always at it.
Let me say one thing.
Here is the paper.
Here is the letter.
They never did it again.
It was then time to start.
Dont you like it?
He came at once.
Give me the letter.
But you must never tell.
It would seem so.
Take care of him.
So they got out and went in.
Can you hear me?
Music is a good thing.
There is only food for one.
Just cut it out.
Let me see him.
Have you been at sea?
We might learn a thing or two.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Why, it was one of his own men.
Who said four?
You must study.
Let him answer us.
This took place at his house, in his room.
It must be in her own house.
Cut your hand open?
Keep watch all night.
Let him grow up with you.
So it always was.
Few had found it.
Any book will tell you that.
Good night, friend.
We dont see it like that.
What was the name of the man who took it?
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
We are together.
It is open?
But it is the same with any life.
She got up.
Then, good night.
It was like new life to him.
But it is all all too late now.
First turn to the left.
Let him follow me.
But they may still come here.
Are you sure of it?
Why is he cross with me?
What would you have me do with my life?
Let me out.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
These were the first people we saw.
Both of us.
Do you know how he made his mark?
Where is the river?
At last we have a man.
No, dont.
For once you are right.
Why, is it late?
And this food?
Do you know where he is?
You are sure of it?
But are you sure of that?
They dont care.
What did you hear?
Who could have thought it?
Let me be and let me live.
But hard to tell.
You should take me there one day.
We are very far from that.
What country does he come from?
There was no letter for me.
Stop and think.
Now or never.
Open the door.
Have you got it?
So take care of me.
Tell me more.
We found it.
Who let you in?
You saw him?
This is real.
You took it.
He saw his men draw back.
And who is this friend?
Is there any answer?
But watch over him.
One never has too much.
In the country?
Let us go in.
Stop, said he.
She is my friend.
Now you must eat.
He might still be up.
Well, run back to her.
It was the first thing he thought of.
So he began to help.
Let me hear your story.
It is a long story.
You will answer for it.
He is at sea.
Let me hear what it is.
He then said, It is time to start.
We never thought of that.
Let me know at once when you will start.
But it was very late.
It is music.
And she left the room.
Why should this be so?
At this time of my life, no.
Who found them out?
Well, what next?
Let me see him at once.
Where is this city?
At four, she said.
We got to let that go.
Watch him, he said.
She must have a hard time with him.
You found him?
There to the left.
It might help.
We should ask him.
Dont you think so?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Why dont you want to go?
Let me go back.
Stop, let me show you the way.
Is my father here?
Then let me have a word with you.
Let me look.
He has children of his own.
You might want it.
Are you my friend?
Where could you keep it?
We must go at once.
What did he answer?
The sun had set long since.
When did you begin?
it took all that time to come over the water.
See him grow up.
No, why should he?
Have you never been there?
He could run no more.
Dont you see that?
We got under way at last.
Does he never go out?
Come over in the sun.
Keep to the left.
And why should they?
Always the same, year after year.
Let me get on with my work.
What is your real name?
You must walk.
Well, let us be sure of that.
He is my father.
Which end is his head?
They may tell us to open it.
Sure of what?
One was on a white horse.
Look at his face.
Why do you stop here?
Let her go.
Take care.
He had two left feet.
How could you let him go so far?
This is my country.
What was it that you thought?
Here he is at last.
Are we late?
How many children?
It was very hard.
A second man got up and went out.
Dont you want any?
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Come here, my friend.
Do you want to cross?
By and by he got it.
Our own people must come first.
It is well thought of.
Where have you been this long while?
They dont know their own country.
Always the same with you people.
They always know.
They never come back.
They are always the same.
She might be at his house.
Here we see the boy at school.
Life is all right.
And then they began to fish.
How would they stop it?
Are we too late?
Was you in my room?
Keep to the right.
But now it is too late.
What did he say in the letter?
And there are four of you?
There were few near me.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Just set still and take it like a man.
And what did you do with that letter?
It is always so.
The children will live just the same.
Do you often come back?
Why, dont you hear it?
What was left of him?
But then you would be close to the sea?
Do you want some more to eat?
But why dont you want to take it?
But you got to play music for them.
They are hard at it.
Say good night.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
It was his own room.
Is it in the city?
He has been been found.
How did it begin?
Come let us see them.
But then it will be too late.
Is that far?
There was no answer.
What do you hear?
You are right, father.
Right here it began.
Think of my father.
Tell her to begin.
Is he a real father?
Who was the letter from?
Did you see his eye?
Let us start, then.
How could you begin?
This took him some time.
You must eat now.
What do you think when you hear music?
He said at last.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Watch over him.
Let me go to the door.
It was white.
Will you never learn?
She never came back.
Let us go back.
Do you have a car?
Let us cross over.
How many are left?
You are sure of that?
Do you have the letter?
Ask one of those men.
You have a car?
How much have you got?
And what did you learn from him?
Let them have it.
Point it at his horse.
Tell us a story.
A call for help, you thought?
Who should it be?
Come at once.
There are only four of us.
No, never.
Come, let us be men.
Let me get to work.
That is the idea.
He is my friend.
Is it far?
Are you sure?
She is still here?
Let me in.
No, stop.
Call the next one.
That night we were just in time.
Do you know what he did last night?
They came over last night.
Let me see it.
Off with her head.
No, said the Tree.
Which story was it?
My father is right.
What should he say?
You got me?
But it would be in the paper.
So, once more, good night.
And now, good night.
She saw no one?
And then we may begin.
We must begin again.
Do you hear that?
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Go to your father.
But take care.
One of us will be here all night.
Well, read the letter again.
Dont tell me.
We got one and they got one.
what river is it?
But let us walk.
You must never tell.
And your children?
What a start that was.
Can you stand?
He may come close.
Who did you learn that from?
But she saw no one?
Dont move, he said.
It will be too late.
Off with his head.
And he left the room.
Dont say that to me.
Only, dont look back.
It is from your father.
We should look at this.
What a night it has been.
We were together.
Still, you never know.
Who took him out of it?
It is so very kind of you both.
Why dont you play?
Good night again.
But what did you hear?
Write an answer.
Have you got that?
That was the first night.
He had only one night more to live.
Just a few.
Who can answer for that?
The other night she left.
Just cut it out, will you?
Do you hear me?
She came over last night.
Good for the country.
And now let us go home.
Have you found it?
Let me see her.
What is life to you?
This is what began it all.
