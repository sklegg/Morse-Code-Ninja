Where in the world did you come from?
But where are we to go?
All right, then.
Where is he?
Look at me.
Show me the way he went.
And where is this man?
What do you think of him?
And why is that?
What is your name?
Who are these men?
You are most kind.
How long have you been here?
Give me a light.
And have you been here long?
Where did you place it?
She had to tell him.
We are here.
Which house is it?
It is great.
When will her mother come?
Did you tell him?
That was very good.
Now, what do you want with me?
How do you take it?
But he is right.
Play with them.
Such as what?
Well, how are you?
He was here.
What will you say?
What you have just said is good, very good.
How can you tell?
How can you think of such a thing?
How much do you want?
You will get on in the world.
It is all the same.
She was the cause of it all.
We will say no more about it, then.
Come with me, then.
Where are we to turn for help?
Why is he here?
Try it on.
What do you mean?
Tell us all about it.
Give it to me, then.
Are you back again?
And what about your mother?
Say no more about it.
How does he use it?
And how in the world did you find them?
And how did you find out?
But who was your mother?
Large or small?
It is very kind of you.
How much are they?
Look at it other way round.
Where are you off to?
But why do you ask?
And off we go.
Much good that would be.
You think so?
And what is her name?
And what will they do with us?
Call me what you will, he said.
Then what kind is it?
Just like me.
What is that in your hand?
And it did me good.
Think of him.
Where are they off to now?
Now come here.
What will each of you give?
After three, he said.
It will take a little time.
Where have they been?
That is right, said the old man.
Then will come our time.
What would you have me do?
Give it me.
He went on his way.
This is the man.
That was a house to look at.
You must come now.
What do you want to ask these people?
It must be where you put it.
Too much of this.
Will you try?
Why are you here?
Is he big?
Where is he now?
Is that right?
Some day you may ask me about it.
Why are you like this?
But what about me?
Too much for me now.
And that was the end of it.
In what part of the house?
Show us where you live, said the man.
this one, too?
Why did he come?
It was now his turn to look about him.
What did he say?
How did you get here?
Well, and what do you think?
There she is again.
And what did he say?
They had all been very good to us.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
How can you find out?
He will ask for it.
You can help me here.
Well, how did it go?
She was right.
You see it every day.
What on earth does this mean?
For how much?
You were near him.
Just look through it.
Is it all right?
Here is the way we put in the time.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
What do you want me to do?
In what year?
But why do you ask me?
What do they say was the cause?
Read that, she said.
But this is the point.
What was it you said to me?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Think what you will.
I would like to see her again in that.
Who is that man?
What a good thing it would be.
Good, he said.
To what end?
This is my point.
Been back long?
Where are you from?
Get to work.
And what was his name?
Where have you been?
What more could a man ask for?
Are you at it again?
Well, go on.
And what did she say?
The world is before you.
He was there too.
Were you here before me?
And they went home.
Why, what do you mean?
Do you think so now?
Well, here he is.
Well, all right.
That is the end of her.
What could set you off in the first place?
But it is just so with the world.
Where did he come from?
Ask her, he said.
Do you think so?
Give him air.
What do you mean by that?
Show me the way.
Have you been here long?
Come with me to the little house.
What do you play?
What did you say your name was?
What does it all mean?
He said that that would help.
He will live.
For some man.
Only two there now.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Will you take me to her?
He has more to give.
Well then, what do you want?
Is she well?
Where are we?
She went on.
Here it is, he said.
Come with me.
No, mother.
Get out of the way.
Say what you want.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
You can say what it is.
Why do you want to know?
How does she use you?
Good day to you.
There will just be time.
And what are they made of?
Move on, then.
Put it on.
Why is that?
We must come back.
Now we see the light.
There was no one near.
You think so, too?
Now, go home.
Good day, one and all.
Get out and play.
Is he a good man?
Think it over.
Read that, he said.
No, tell me.
She came up to them.
where did she come from?
What on earth do you mean?
And do you know why?
How could she say such a thing.
He went to him.
Where is she?
Ask him to show up?
When will it take place?
Is it as good now?
It was high time.
There is the little boy.
All in good time.
They want more.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Take this and this.
Is it any good?
Then they will follow you?
See, they are here.
How on earth do you know?
If you want to know, go and find out.
take them all.
He is at my house.
Well then, tell him so.
There is more to tell.
And how old were you at that time?
Where does he live?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Hand it in.
Here she is.
She has a house?
Tell me all about it.
What do you think of this?
Do you know me?
He said too much.
That was a good time.
Why, what is it, then?
What is in your hand?
It is the same thing.
You are a good boy.
And where is she, then?
Are you here for good?
Where to, now?
Where could he be?
Do it for me.
Is this the man?
there are only two.
Turn this way.
Is there no one who can help me?
Here it is.
At your house?
Give me your hand.
Take some, she said.
What did you say that for?
How can you say that?
Well, and is that all?
Give me my work.
And where is he now?
There is no place like home.
Show it to me.
When will he come back?
Well, what do you think about it?
Do you think she was?
Where are you?
Are they like each other?
What could she mean by it?
What have you been after?
Where do they get that?
But he does so need a mother.
Is it large?
But what does it mean?
Very well then.
What do they want?
Very well, show him to me.
They are here.
That would be very good.
How old are you?
Follow me, said the man.
Can you point it out to me?
Well, what do you think?
Very well, he said.
And who is the man?
Now it was time to act.
We are who we say we are.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
But what did you want?
There is no one here to see.
Just look at her.
Now, you know me.
Who will tell her?
Is there some for me?
What does she think about me?
What do you think of her?
She has been with him many long years.
What does all this mean?
Give me more than that
But where is he?
This for me?
What does one live for?
And a very good thing, too.
And what do you think?
There, that does me good.
What did he tell you?
What do you think of that?
He was at work again.
Three, he said.
How old was she?
It would be very kind of you.
Here is my hand.
You know, you see right through people.
One, two, three.
See, here it is.
Is it you or me?
Say no more.
It is very high.
Time to get out.
Where do you live?
And where was the place?
And where is it?
Well, tell me.
Why do you want water?
The first act was over.
Can you take me?
This is the first act.
You are right.
But you must.
Will you come with me?
Now tell me.
Can you help me find my way?
What does she want?
Then why are you here?
How did you get me out?
That is just my point.
That is all one can say about her.
How did that help you?
Is that all you want?
Go and try.
do you come from the end of the world?
Why are they here?
Tell me about it.
You are all very kind to me.
You must take me with you.
What does he mean?
But where is it?
Now where did they come from?
Do you want me to do it?
Come and help me.
What is his name?
That is right.
Too much in the way.
What do you want?
Tell me his name.
And in she went.
What was his name?
There was work to do.
Tell us your name.
Well, did he?
Well, read it.
You must tell me.
Would you now like to look round my place?
Tell me who made the world.
Think no more about that.
He was so kind.
