This voice was that of my father.
Half the town was there.
He knew nothing.
In that town there is a street.
It is time for bed.
I hear his voice in the house.
They need a rest.
If only they would be quick.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
It was a cold, dark night.
We must be quick.
You are free to do so.
Answer me that, miss.
Yes, go and find out.
Very well, wait a minute.
Why should my father fly?
He must be in the same boat as us.
Money is no object?
What has he done?
Oh, very well, he said.
Never mind how he came here.
Go in there and drive them out.
No, nothing at all.
Nothing she can eat?
Well, sit down.
Lead me to him.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Well, sit down by me.
But wait a minute.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Yes, that is true.
Let me see your plan.
Fine, very fine.
Nothing could be more simple.
They would cry.
It was a dark night.
Yes, you are right.
Wait a minute.
He gave me this paper.
She heard and saw nothing.
He has a good voice still.
Oh, he is so kind.
He ran up to them.
Is that possible?
But what then must be done?
Oh, this is too much.
Oh, nothing.
Oh, you are there.
See what you have done.
Laugh, if you will.
Yes and no.
It is nothing.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Yes, she could sing that.
Help me sit up.
The island was a mile long.
Just let us go free.
What have you done?
Do you talk in your sleep?
Yes, and no.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Dont laugh.
But what must be done?
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Nothing at all.
How is that done?
Oh, that.
And sit in the dark?
Oh, tell me.
Perhaps he did.
It is all done.
Oh, of course.
He will sleep an hour.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
What more is to be done?
He had, to be sure, done much.
That is a fact.
Of course it is.
is it come yet?
Oh, if men only knew.
Get to bed.
It was cold and dark.
It stood behind the door.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
It was full of people.
All that for nothing?
Can it be possible?
Yes, my love?
It must be done.
His plan is very simple.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Wonder what he does.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Oh, all right.
Yes, go on.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Try to sleep.
Wait for me.
Take good note of it.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
This is a test.
You love a certain person.
Did it all rest on me?
Who gave it to you?
Who brought you up?
Bring this with you.
Of course they will.
He never said nothing.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Here is our plan.
There is a lot of people.
And yet you are the better off?
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Then all was dark again.
He left long ago.
Oh, do you know?
Oh, how can you sleep?
He is among us.
Then lead the way.
And then the game began all over again.
Yes, he said.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Nothing could have been better.
Money is power.
It was so long ago.
Yes, there it is.
Clear the table.
Which box do you mean?
And what have you done to me?
Is it certain?
Of course it might.
Do you have my note?
What can be done?
What have they done?
But she is nothing to me now.
Better sit still.
He saw nothing.
It is his voice.
But never mind that.
Yes, but only for you and me.
What brought you here?
Why did you bring him here?
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Let him go free?
Be quick, for the time is short.
And here is the note.
Never mind that.
Yes, of course.
What have they done with my work?
You are in my power.
The night was dark.
She began to cry.
That would be a fine thing.
His will be done.
What a game.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
You can sleep here.
You must stay.
Decide if you are going back home.
Well, of course.
Come, let me show you my plan.
But let us see your plan.
Yes, what is it?
The night was very dark.
Wait a second.
Oh, dont ask me.
All right then, sit down.
Yes, all right.
and so he decide he go back home.
He was here a minute ago.
Clear my name.
Yes, it did.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Oh, go on.
Quick, friend, quick.
Are you strong?
Well, what does that lead up to?
They know nothing about it.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Sit down, he said.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Then he must be a wonder.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Nothing is more simple.
Oh, do the best you can.
It was very dark.
But that is nothing to us.
It was so very long ago.
There is your old bed.
This made him wonder more and more.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
You must stay with me.
Is that a fact?
Oh, but you were there?
Well, what about my plan?
The whole day had been hot.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Go back to bed.
We are more strong together.
How can a little dog laugh?
It was right in front of us.
But they could see nothing.
It is very clear.
How long would you keep me in town?
She was still game.
Well then, be quick.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Did she stay long?
Oh, man.
Like these in shape and size?
Yes, it is true.
It is no use, said a voice.
Oh, take those off.
A fine thing too.
His first cry was for his father.
It was a kind of language between us.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Oh, that is very simple.
Come quick.
She could think of nothing more to say.
The water ran dry.
Is he in bed?
My mind was soon made up.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Leave the rest to me.
Again came the voice.
Do you see that island?
You can hear that, miss?
Yes, we know that.
Yes, said the old man.
It was done.
Behind my bed.
Where can you wait for me?
Look at that dark water.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
He must wait.
You know nothing about it.
It was a record run.
Oh let me in.
Now we must wait.
In a minute.
You know you must say yes.
He had made up his mind.
Nothing had come of it.
My mind is made up.
Fly, my friend.
Then bring them to me, she said.
All of this was possible.
It was a very dark night.
The old man gave no answer.
It was hot.
There is no one in that room behind you.
It is done.
Good to rest once in a way.
Yes, once.
Just go to sleep.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
They all fall to the ground.
That was well done.
Yes, that was a picture book.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Play the game out.
Oh, to be sure.
All was dark.
How was it done?
He is in the box.
What has brought you here?
In her name, then, let it be done.
It was brought to me.
Never mind me.
Is my father in town?
Wait for me here, all of you.
Oh, no.
There is nothing more to be said.
Stay where you are.
Why, of course.
And yet you said he had money.
Of course she will.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
That is possible.
It is a real bed.
No, nothing of the kind.
Hold on a minute.
It might have done me good.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Wonder if he has a name.
Yes, very well.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Yes, sit down.
But how long ago?
They call him a fine boy.
Let us sit down.
But it must be done soon.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Wonder is it like that.
Her voice was low.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Nothing new under the sun.
Free to do what?
There is no possible way.
Oh, just listen.
Then it is certain?
It is certain.
Go and rest.
You brought no one with you?
It was a warm night.
Well, there he stood.
Yes, she said.
Oh, do as you like.
Keep clear of him.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Clear the way.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Is it possible?
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Well yes, you are right.
It is possible.
And what a voice she has.
Yes, he did.
And you can do nothing until then?
She gave me her hand.
Did he fall?
We brought them in.
Yes, she was back.
Are they on foot?
You knew it, and said nothing?
We are free to act and think.
Bring it here.
You must have a rest.
What is power?
And he told you nothing?
Let her wait.
Well, miss?
What is done is done.
What kind of voice is it?
What did the letter contain?
It has to be done.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
You better stay here all night.
She got her hand free.
He began to laugh.
Behind every book is a man.
It must be done at once.
The city was soon behind me.
There, by the wheel.
Oh, take me with you.
Yes, but what did she say?
Did she fall?
Of course he was right.
How long ago?
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
He stood up.
There was more to be done.
Come, and we can rest together.
Will you rest here a little?
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Be back in a minute.
Bring them here.
How was that possible?
Yes, to be sure.
Oh, come now.
What age is he?
At his side was a large green box.
The snow is deep.
Wait and see.
Sit down, said the old man.
You will fall.
