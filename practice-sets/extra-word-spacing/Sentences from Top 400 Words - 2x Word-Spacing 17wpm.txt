A young man?
Why did it happen?
The family was at home.
He will leave me.
Well, young man?
Ten will be early enough.
And will you direct us?
Is that true?
You are in love with me?
Did you tell him your whole story?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
Let me also ask you a question.
A better man than you.
You love him?
Long and the short of it.
He had my love.
You know me well enough.
But why must you leave me so soon?
This money was for her.
There are four hundred?
Well, are you ready?
you know better than that.
It was cold.
Against what side?
But she is very young.
From then on it was war between them.
Do you remember him?
We had better go in.
How do you feel now?
Have you heard from him often?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Is it true?
Better cross here.
The world is big enough.
He never heard.
If you only knew.
Are you ready?
They had much to talk about.
They can have all our half of the house.
Listen to this, will you?
That would be the best way.
Did they ever go back?
How could that happen?
He never told us what it was she said.
It would have been more simple.
Your true father?
They had several children.
Never heard of it.
Then get ready at once.
We got her half way.
No, my love.
She was only a little girl.
Had you heard?
He put his hand over part of the map.
Let this man pass.
Are you here on leave?
He has money.
Why do we love?
Did you get any money?
Why do you serve?
Pull it more to your side.
But what did we ever get for it?
We will talk about that.
She had very little notice from him.
Half a mile?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
And you are still so young.
That is enough for me.
Do you want any money?
Can it be true?
Hold it up to the light.
Take a hold of it.
Hold her hand.
Remember that time?
What do you mean by that question?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
You will soon know.
Why do they want to make her sing?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Leave off that.
And so they began to talk.
How many children did he leave?
They had heard all that before.
Half as many is too much.
It was true to life.
They told me to.
A house is on fire?
How short his time.
Is your man white or black?
Never heard of it before.
Light my fire.
Never heard of him.
She must be told.
Do you love me?
Have you a family?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
The dog is always with him.
Put down three and carry five.
How does this happen?
Have you told her?
We call it black.
You were told.
And serve them right.
We must make the best of it.
Much of it was true.
Every word you said was heard.
And you will always love him?
We serve them.
It will interest you, said he.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
But let that pass.
He is very simple.
what could be better?
In an hour?
Take notice.
Why talk to me?
Where are you off to so early?
She told me to ask you.
Are they made to order?
Look to the west.
Let me see him, said the young man.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
That was the rule, she said.
The rock was very small.
Take good care of the little girl.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
How did this happen?
Does she go fast?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
When do you leave?
You saw the person?
Feel better then.
She knew at once.
Have you heard?
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
What does he feel?
We had a list.
And you can sing?
That is enough.
You had better go.
She told me all about it.
If you know it, that is enough.
And that is the whole point.
Can she sing?
Long live the king.
It is the rule.
The night was cold and still.
But he never heard me.
What will happen to us?
You are right, young man.
Who was it told me his name?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
You are on a ship?
He said, the work is now complete.
Little girl, where have you been?
And why do you serve?
In an hour it will be at the door.
You may leave the room.
This is simple.
She is very plain.
Do you remember me?
Has she any family?
What size do you want?
Leave any for him?
They are still young.
What can happen?
About the usual time.
What have you against me now?
You are cold.
This was true.
But how simple it is.
It was all she could do to hold in.
But listen to this, he said.
Young man, you will go far.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Was he young or old?
Who told you that?
You may go, said the King.
But one day you must feel it.
But listen to me.
It has been there ever since.
This is my body.
Ten, did you say?
Let me hear from you soon.
Are you better?
When did this happen?
We were up early.
That must be true.
Now listen to me.
It would be better if you went to the war.
There was no wind.
How soon will he be here?
We took our leave early, and left together.
She was so young, too.
You must travel.
What kind of a bird?
you should know her better than me.
That is very simple.
Listen to them, he said.
What is there to talk about?
Better write it here.
Let us leave them, she said.
You are right, my love.
Let me remember what he said.
It is a rock.
On fire, on fire.
You will always love him?
Keep in step.
Better late than never.
Let us pass.
Where did they get the money from?
In short, take me.
Is your family well?
Are you still cold?
I have no children to love me.
She is the first person in this house.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
We dont know enough.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
How do you feel?
He said, get him out of the road.
An example would be better.
What a state he was in.
You remember the place, my father?
That is true.
Read them, said the King.
Did he though?
What will happen now?
Which king?
No, he is a man about my size.
Let that pass.
Fire and water, earth and air.
Is the wind north or south?
Answer me this one question.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Do you own a dog?
So we came down this road.
It is a fire.
And so they knew that it was true.
The King Went to him.
You are better than that.
So the question was, what to do?
So do you, my love.
They left in the morning.
We knew them both.
Leave me out of the question.
And what does she want the money for?
They knew it.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Try it on the dog first.
Five young children.
He had enough of it.
Pull together.
How far from the body?
But enough of this.
It was true.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
They all heard me.
To know her is to love her.
It is a young girl.
And how did he make his money?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
She is much better.
What a question.
Ask them to sing one more song.
How does it feel?
It was a round table.
Does he love you?
He is better than any of you.
Are you all ready?
Are you ready to play?
It is cold.
you must step out.
Had they been heard?
Made me feel so young.
Can you sing?
Then what would happen?
No less, no more.
Are we ready?
He got it this morning.
This will pass in no time.
That was the question.
Are you in love with her?
Then you will know me better.
We are ready.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Let us talk about you.
Now, listen.
What have you heard?
She was a good girl.
And then he told all he knew.
He knew them.
Who told you so?
Do you know that old lay?
You are a good girl.
What is love?
You must leave that to me.
Where he was, no one knew.
Listen to him.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
Listen to me.
Do you remember?
You can pass through the door.
It can never happen.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Let us talk a little about my father.
who told you you could?
That may be true.
Do you love her much?
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Pass this way, then.
An hour and a half.
She knew what was good for children.
Before you leave, tell us.
No more money?
One other question, said he.
You have an hour.
And dont talk to me.
She is fast?
It is true.
The night was cold.
Will you answer that question?
As soon as you left, it began.
Your watch is slow.
