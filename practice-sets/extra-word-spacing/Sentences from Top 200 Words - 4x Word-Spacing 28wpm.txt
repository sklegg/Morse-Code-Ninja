You know, you see right through people.
Were you here before me?
What could she mean by it?
What do you think of her?
And in she went.
Much good that would be.
Turn this way.
Now, what do you want with me?
Why are you like this?
Where have they been?
When will he come back?
Where are you from?
Who will tell her?
Show me the way he went.
What could set you off in the first place?
All right, then.
Give it to me, then.
Where could he be?
How do you take it?
And what about your mother?
Is it any good?
Well then, what do you want?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Why, what is it, then?
Give me more than that
No, mother.
Here is the way we put in the time.
For some man.
There was work to do.
Well, how did it go?
Come and help me.
How can you think of such a thing?
Some day you may ask me about it.
How can you say that?
Say no more.
And what do you think?
Here it is.
It is very high.
What do you think of this?
It was now his turn to look about him.
Come with me to the little house.
Where did you place it?
And what did she say?
Is that right?
What a good thing it would be.
That is all one can say about her.
Have you been here long?
Get to work.
And what is her name?
Then they will follow you?
Just like me.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
There is no place like home.
Good, he said.
How old are you?
Follow me, said the man.
When will her mother come?
What is that in your hand?
That is right.
Why, what do you mean?
There is the little boy.
She had to tell him.
He was here.
Think no more about that.
There is no one here to see.
But it is just so with the world.
That was very good.
Can you point it out to me?
For how much?
Read that, she said.
You are right.
How could she say such a thing.
You think so, too?
What will each of you give?
Now where did they come from?
there are only two.
What on earth does this mean?
Is there no one who can help me?
Show it to me.
Well, go on.
Tell me his name.
Give me your hand.
What is in your hand?
What do they want?
What more could a man ask for?
How does he use it?
Do you want me to do it?
Read that, he said.
Is she well?
She has been with him many long years.
Here it is, he said.
Three, he said.
Time to get out.
You think so?
Will you come with me?
This for me?
What on earth do you mean?
You must come now.
What do you mean?
It must be where you put it.
He was so kind.
And do you know why?
Call me what you will, he said.
Just look through it.
When will it take place?
She came up to them.
And they went home.
And how in the world did you find them?
And why is that?
Where have you been?
And have you been here long?
But why do you ask?
Just look at her.
It is great.
Do you think so now?
But where is he?
Are you at it again?
You can say what it is.
Well, read it.
You will get on in the world.
Too much in the way.
It was high time.
And where is this man?
Think of him.
Here she is.
But why do you ask me?
But you must.
And it did me good.
Where is he?
They had all been very good to us.
What does it all mean?
Show us where you live, said the man.
But where is it?
He is at my house.
What does one live for?
There was no one near.
And where was the place?
Where do you live?
It would be very kind of you.
Where are we to turn for help?
See, here it is.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
What does all this mean?
Tell us your name.
Now tell me.
Where is she?
Tell me all about it.
There, that does me good.
Too much of this.
All in good time.
What do you want?
Only two there now.
That would be very good.
In what part of the house?
Where does he live?
Would you now like to look round my place?
But he is right.
The world is before you.
And how did you find out?
Is it all right?
Is it large?
You must tell me.
He has more to give.
Here is my hand.
Think it over.
But what does it mean?
What did he tell you?
It will take a little time.
Why are you here?
That is right, said the old man.
Why do you want water?
Say what you want.
What does she want?
Ask her, he said.
Put it on.
And what was his name?
where did she come from?
But who was your mother?
This is my point.
You are most kind.
Such as what?
Good day to you.
What do they say was the cause?
You are all very kind to me.
See, they are here.
How on earth do you know?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Very well then.
Why do you want to know?
Do you think she was?
How much are they?
Where is he now?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
this one, too?
He will ask for it.
Why did he come?
What does he mean?
Now we see the light.
Which house is it?
Did you tell him?
Where to, now?
Come with me, then.
Take this and this.
And who is the man?
It is the same thing.
Then will come our time.
Say no more about it.
One, two, three.
But what about me?
There will just be time.
She has a house?
I would like to see her again in that.
Are you back again?
Now, go home.
Well, and what do you think?
Where do they get that?
What was it you said to me?
Well, what do you think?
Ask him to show up?
He was at work again.
Well, did he?
Do you think so?
Where are you off to?
Give me my work.
Who is that man?
Is he big?
He said too much.
What did he say?
What do you want me to do?
What do you play?
There she is again.
do you come from the end of the world?
Why is that?
What do you think of him?
Can you help me find my way?
To what end?
How does she use you?
Are you here for good?
Look at me.
There is more to tell.
What do you think of that?
And off we go.
Play with them.
What have you been after?
And how old were you at that time?
But he does so need a mother.
But this is the point.
He went to him.
He was there too.
How can you find out?
Is it as good now?
Show me the way.
Large or small?
Get out and play.
What did you say your name was?
We are here.
Too much for me now.
She went on.
Well, and is that all?
Where are we?
What does she think about me?
Are they like each other?
What will you say?
That is the end of her.
How old was she?
And where is she, then?
Well, how are you?
What did you say that for?
She was right.
Good day, one and all.
And where is he now?
It is very kind of you.
Now, you know me.
You are a good boy.
Now come here.
He will live.
Get out of the way.
Will you take me to her?
Well then, tell him so.
How did that help you?
She was the cause of it all.
How much do you want?
And what are they made of?
If you want to know, go and find out.
Then why are you here?
Is he a good man?
Take some, she said.
Tell us all about it.
And that was the end of it.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
It is all the same.
That is just my point.
In what year?
But where are we to go?
This is the first act.
They want more.
Who are these men?
Where are you?
You must take me with you.
They are here.
Do it for me.
Do you know me?
No, tell me.
We must come back.
Hand it in.
After three, he said.
He said that that would help.
What is your name?
And a very good thing, too.
Is there some for me?
Is that all you want?
Where did he come from?
Been back long?
Why is he here?
And where is it?
He went on his way.
Well, all right.
Well, here he is.
Move on, then.
Then what kind is it?
Try it on.
Give it me.
What was his name?
Give me a light.
That was a good time.
This is the man.
What do you want to ask these people?
Where in the world did you come from?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
What you have just said is good, very good.
Can you take me?
Very well, he said.
What is his name?
You were near him.
But what did you want?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Very well, show him to me.
Give him air.
Think what you will.
Is it you or me?
What do you mean by that?
Is this the man?
You can help me here.
Come with me.
Will you try?
That was a house to look at.
How long have you been here?
We are who we say we are.
Well, what do you think about it?
Where are they off to now?
Well, tell me.
Go and try.
And what will they do with us?
Tell me about it.
How did you get me out?
Now it was time to act.
You see it every day.
What would you have me do?
Look at it other way round.
Why are they here?
take them all.
The first act was over.
Tell me who made the world.
How can you tell?
And what did he say?
At your house?
How did you get here?
We will say no more about it, then.
