but what if it is?
Then there is more to do.
And who are you?
What is it for?
But will he see it?
How did he do it?
No was there one?
And what is that?
When is it?
Then, how do you know?
What was it?
What was it about?
There is but one thing to do.
How was that?
She has it.
But it was of no use.
When was that?
And when will you call?
They said no more.
And do you like her?
How can it be?
And what do you call her?
There you are, he said.
Did you see it?
Who was he?
We have him.
You have it.
But when will that be?
Or so they said.
What is it like?
How are you?
Look at it.
Come this way.
Tqhen you may go.
Is that all?
What do they call you?
Did you see her?
Who will go first?
Are you there?
How long has he been there?
What have you come for?
Is he there?
That will do, said he.
The time will come.
Did you know him?
who can it be?
Which is it?
The time had come.
You know more than we do.
Is she like him?
What did they do?
At what time?
And what was it for?
but we can go and see.
So it was.
Look at them.
Who are you?
What did he do to you?
And could she see him?
Do you know what you look like?
Is it time?
So there it was.
Do you know?
What other way is there to look at it?
what is it?
And has it come to this?
There he is, do you see him?
Will you come and see her?
But it has been so long.
Go on, he said.
But who was she?
Will that do?
How is he now?
What are we to do?
Look at him.
Then what are you up to now?
What is there to see?
Would you like some?
Can one see from there?
That was it.
Now there is no more to be said.
Did you know them?
And is that all?
No one will come, she said.
How is she?
There they are.
What can we do, then?
Who was that?
Do as you will.
One or two?
What time is it?
But how is that?
Do as you like.
who, then, are you?
Do you know what it is?
Do you know him?
You have them?
How can you know?
And what did you see?
What will you do, then?
May we come in?
what has she to do with it?
Then how many are there?
What is that?
Do they know him?
And all for what?
Then who are you?
So it is.
Now what are we to do with you?
Is it over?
That is what she did.
What do you make of it?
But he had to have it.
But what have they been up to?
What are you up to?
You may go.
What could it be?
What is it about?
But how about you?
You can have some.
Do you see him?
and so on, and so on.
Can it be?
Is that it?
There were two of them.
At what number?
How did you come by it?
There he is, you see.
What do you make of that?
You can go.
And what do you make of it?
So that was the way.
Look at it this way.
Is that her?
What DO you know of him?
So be it.
How did she do it?
What would she have said?
When was it?
Look over it.
What is he like?
There he is, she said.
Can you do that?
What is it all about?
And who was that?
But what are you up to?
What can this be?
Would you do what he did?
But what is it?
What was he like?
That will do, he said.
How do you do?
You know how it is with her.
Then make it up.
Is it like him?
And what did you do then?
Has it come to this?
Who is she?
And how did you find out?
Who and what are you?
There you are.
Out of the way.
Do you see it?
We have no water.
You can do it.
Now you know.
But he had no time.
But what will you do?
Do you know her?
That is a long time.
What is all this?
Then what is it?
But WHAT DID you see?
What did you do then?
Did you know her?
How did you know about it?
are you there?
What do you see?
How would you like to have it?
Do you like him?
He said no.
That was all she said.
And who is this?
It was from you.
Had to look the other way.
Call him in.
but there was more to it than this.
Now is your time.
How is he?
But so it is.
And do you like him?
You can have some.
One or two?
Did you know her?
Look over it.
Who and what are you?
She has it.
What time is it?
Go on, he said.
Is she like him?

And when will you call?
Who are you?
What is there to see?
What is that?
Do you see him?
And what do you make of it?
How did he do it?
So there it was.
Look at it.
There you are, he said.
And what did you see?
You may go.
Will that do?
And what was it for?

No one will come, she said.
Do as you will.

What will you do, then?
Come this way.
And who are you?
