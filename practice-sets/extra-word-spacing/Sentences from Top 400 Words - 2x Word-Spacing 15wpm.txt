They told me to.
She was only a little girl.
What size do you want?
Pull together.
Let me remember what he said.
You may go, said the King.
They had several children.
You will always love him?
That is enough for me.
Can you sing?
Take notice.
It is a young girl.
So we came down this road.
Keep in step.
But what did we ever get for it?
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Pass this way, then.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
This is my body.
How could that happen?
Did they ever go back?
Had you heard?
To know her is to love her.
Better late than never.
No more money?
They can have all our half of the house.
This will pass in no time.
We call it black.
Leave off that.
She told me all about it.
What can happen?
But why must you leave me so soon?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
It would be better if you went to the war.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
Never heard of him.
You will soon know.
Where are you off to so early?
You saw the person?
That would be the best way.
A young man?
You are a good girl.
Why did it happen?
He got it this morning.
Better cross here.
Let that pass.
How does it feel?
He knew them.
It would have been more simple.
Why do we love?
And so they began to talk.
Do you remember me?
No, my love.
They knew it.
That must be true.
And serve them right.
Leave me out of the question.
Then you will know me better.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
But let that pass.
Can she sing?
Who told you that?
Do you remember?
And that is the whole point.
Had they been heard?
Let us leave them, she said.
Better write it here.
As soon as you left, it began.
And will you direct us?
Listen to them, he said.
That was the rule, she said.
The night was cold.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Can it be true?
No, he is a man about my size.
You are on a ship?
Five young children.
Now, listen.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
But listen to me.
Listen to me.
Is that true?
That may be true.
We had better go in.
Long and the short of it.
That is enough.
You love him?
But he never heard me.
He said, get him out of the road.
You are in love with me?
It was all she could do to hold in.
Has she any family?
You must travel.
Are you in love with her?
you should know her better than me.
If you know it, that is enough.
A better man than you.
Are you ready?
Fire and water, earth and air.
It was true to life.
And what does she want the money for?
The King Went to him.
Why do they want to make her sing?
You know me well enough.
They are still young.
Remember that time?
Read them, said the King.
On fire, on fire.
She must be told.
How soon will he be here?
Ask them to sing one more song.
We had a list.
Your true father?
It is cold.
The dog is always with him.
Is the wind north or south?
It will interest you, said he.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Are you all ready?
Let this man pass.
Answer me this one question.
you must step out.
Take a hold of it.
Does he love you?
When did this happen?
Much of it was true.
What will happen now?
who told you you could?
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Now listen to me.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
This was true.
Try it on the dog first.
Let us pass.
Well, young man?
Are you still cold?
What have you heard?
How far from the body?
She was a good girl.
An example would be better.
Have you heard?
You may leave the room.
We took our leave early, and left together.
He had my love.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
Which king?
And so they knew that it was true.
Made me feel so young.
She is much better.
Does she go fast?
She told me to ask you.
Ten, did you say?
She had very little notice from him.
When do you leave?
I have no children to love me.
If you only knew.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
What kind of a bird?
We will talk about that.
From then on it was war between them.
But she is very young.
Who told you so?
Do you know that old lay?
But one day you must feel it.
It was true.
But listen to this, he said.
Before you leave, tell us.
what could be better?
What have you against me now?
One other question, said he.
Let us talk a little about my father.
Who was it told me his name?
Do you love me?
In an hour?
We serve them.
A house is on fire?
What a state he was in.
You remember the place, my father?
It is the rule.
Is your man white or black?
In short, take me.
Take good care of the little girl.
They left in the morning.
He never heard.
Then what would happen?
It can never happen.
An hour and a half.
Put down three and carry five.
And dont talk to me.
She is fast?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
He has money.
We knew them both.
Did you tell him your whole story?
What is love?
What will happen to us?
That is true.
There was no wind.
He had enough of it.
It is true.
Are they made to order?
He is very simple.
You are right, my love.
You had better go.
He put his hand over part of the map.
He never told us what it was she said.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Are we ready?
How does this happen?
How many children did he leave?
What a question.
Your watch is slow.
About the usual time.
This is simple.
Was he young or old?
It has been there ever since.
Long live the king.
Against what side?
Leave any for him?
She knew what was good for children.
Young man, you will go far.
Why do you serve?
And why do you serve?
You must leave that to me.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
Did you get any money?
It is a rock.
Are you here on leave?
They had much to talk about.
Half a mile?
The night was cold and still.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Light my fire.
Well, are you ready?
You are better than that.
Have you heard from him often?
She is very plain.
And how did he make his money?
Did he though?
Half as many is too much.
That was the question.
The family was at home.
She is the first person in this house.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Do you love her much?
We must make the best of it.
The world is big enough.
They all heard me.
How do you feel?
You can pass through the door.
And you are still so young.
Do you want any money?
Hold it up to the light.
There are four hundred?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Every word you said was heard.
Where did they get the money from?
What does he feel?
She was so young, too.
So the question was, what to do?
You were told.
It was cold.
Never heard of it.
That is very simple.
And you can sing?
It was a round table.
He said, the work is now complete.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Have you told her?
You are cold.
Let us talk about you.
And you will always love him?
Let me hear from you soon.
He will leave me.
Listen to this, will you?
Do you remember him?
This money was for her.
He is better than any of you.
What do you mean by that question?
But how simple it is.
We were up early.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
How did this happen?
Is your family well?
Why talk to me?
Where he was, no one knew.
We got her half way.
Feel better then.
No less, no more.
Look to the west.
It is a fire.
Will you answer that question?
Do you own a dog?
They had heard all that before.
So do you, my love.
Listen to him.
Let me also ask you a question.
How short his time.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Never heard of it before.
Have you a family?
And then he told all he knew.
She knew at once.
The rock was very small.
What is there to talk about?
you know better than that.
Pull it more to your side.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
How do you feel now?
We are ready.
You are right, young man.
Ten will be early enough.
Is it true?
We dont know enough.
Are you better?
You have an hour.
Hold her hand.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
Are you ready to play?
Then get ready at once.
Let me see him, said the young man.
Little girl, where have you been?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
But enough of this.
