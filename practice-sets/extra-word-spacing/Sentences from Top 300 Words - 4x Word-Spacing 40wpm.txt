Come, let us be men.
Let me go back.
She must have a hard time with him.
He then said, It is time to start.
You might want it.
He came at once.
Are you sure?
Keep to the left.
Let me be and let me live.
Off with his head.
They came over last night.
They always know.
No, never.
Is there any answer?
But it is the same with any life.
Off with her head.
Let us start, then.
That is the idea.
It might help.
We never thought of that.
Is that far?
Tell us a story.
She never came back.
There was no answer.
We got to let that go.
Cut him down.
But why dont you want to take it?
So take care of me.
One of us will be here all night.
This took him some time.
And who is this friend?
Let me see it.
Why, is it late?
Do you have the letter?
Write an answer.
Well, run back to her.
Do we stop here?
Dont you think so?
Right here it began.
What country does he come from?
Is he a real father?
Here he is at last.
It was like new life to him.
You have a car?
Who could have thought it?
Now let me have it.
Let me see her.
They never come back.
We got under way at last.
Sure of what?
Are you my friend?
But you must never tell.
She came in just now by the back door.
Which end is his head?
Let me see him at once.
We should look at this.
Good night, friend.
How would they stop it?
Come here, my friend.
Dont you see that?
The children will live just the same.
She might be at his house.
And now let us go home.
Why, it was one of his own men.
Why dont you play?
And now, good night.
Here is the letter.
You must eat now.
Do you have a car?
Who took him out of it?
What a start that was.
Only, dont look back.
But it would be in the paper.
She got up.
Why should they?
Who should it be?
They may tell us to open it.
It was his own room.
But they may still come here.
And why should they?
Have you been at sea?
Have you got it?
They never did it again.
This is what began it all.
There are only four of us.
And your children?
Open the door.
He might still be up.
He said at last.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
We are very far from that.
Life is all right.
Dont you like it?
But hard to tell.
But she saw no one?
Let me go to the door.
No, said the Tree.
She came over last night.
Good for the country.
He may come close.
Have you never been there?
It is a long story.
We may be too late.
These were the first people we saw.
We got one and they got one.
But take care.
Call the next one.
Let me say one thing.
Where has she run off to?
A second man got up and went out.
If you know, why dont you tell?
She is my friend.
But what did you hear?
Come eat with me.
Where is this city?
So they got out and went in.
Just cut it out.
We must begin again.
What is your real name?
Who said four?
it took all that time to come over the water.
And then they began to fish.
Dont say that to me.
What should he say?
Can you stand?
So it always was.
And this food?
It was the first thing he thought of.
Just a few.
It is music.
You must study.
Have you got that?
No, stop.
And what did you do with that letter?
Stop and think.
Did you see his eye?
Are you sure of it?
What was it that you thought?
Why is he cross with me?
Let him answer us.
Dont you want any?
My father is right.
By and by he got it.
Is my father here?
Music is a good thing.
When did you begin?
Let me look.
He is always at it.
Well, what next?
Any book will tell you that.
Now you must eat.
We must go at once.
To the left.
But watch over him.
How many children?
He is my friend.
He had two left feet.
Where is the river?
This is my country.
How could you begin?
You saw him?
For once you are right.
Well, let us be sure of that.
First turn to the left.
But you got to play music for them.
It was white.
Here is the paper.
At this time of my life, no.
Both of us.
Do you know where he is?
Never see him again.
One never has too much.
Who did you learn that from?
He could run no more.
No, why should he?
Look at his face.
Just cut it out, will you?
He has been been found.
She saw no one?
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Why dont you want to go?
We found it.
Say good night.
What did you hear?
You are sure of that?
Let us go back.
what river is it?
Why, dont you hear it?
We were together.
Let her go.
Take care of him.
Do you know how he made his mark?
That night we were just in time.
Let me hear your story.
How did it begin?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Take care.
Let me get to work.
But it was very late.
Good night again.
What do you think of the music?
What was the name of the man who took it?
We might learn a thing or two.
What was left of him?
Do you want some more to eat?
Let me in.
But then you would be close to the sea?
And then we may begin.
Let them have it.
It is so very kind of you both.
What would you have me do with my life?
Watch over him.
Our own people must come first.
What do you hear?
Let us go in.
How many are left?
It must be in her own house.
Ask one of those men.
He has children of his own.
It is well thought of.
Then, good night.
He saw his men draw back.
One was on a white horse.
You got me?
Here we see the boy at school.
What did he answer?
You found him?
Come over in the sun.
He is my father.
Do you want to cross?
Are we late?
Dont move, he said.
There were few near me.
But then it will be too late.
Why should this be so?
Then let me have a word with you.
At four, she said.
There, do you hear?
You are right, father.
Who found them out?
Is it in the city?
Keep to the right.
Are we too late?
Always the same, year after year.
Let us cross over.
Who can answer for that?
Do you often come back?
It is from your father.
No, dont.
Can you hear me?
There is only food for one.
Just set still and take it like a man.
What do you think when you hear music?
And she left the room.
See him grow up.
Let me see him.
Does he never go out?
We are together.
Dont tell me.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
One night more and he would be on his way.
They dont care.
So, once more, good night.
It is open?
But let us walk.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Few had found it.
Where have you been this long while?
It was then time to start.
Now or never.
But now it is too late.
Let him follow me.
Always the same with you people.
Tell me more.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Will you never learn?
In the country?
She saw it.
Let me get on with my work.
You took it.
Come let us see them.
It is always so.
Stop, said he.
It was the last day of the year.
Let me know at once when you will start.
How could you let him go so far?
And he left the room.
So he began to help.
You must never tell.
Here is the book.
Think of my father.
It would seem so.
Come at once.
And there are four of you?
The other night she left.
Was you in my room?
This took place at his house, in his room.
Let me hear what it is.
We should ask him.
We dont see it like that.
Still, you never know.
Is it far?
What did he say in the letter?
Do you hear that?
Let him grow up with you.
Which story was it?
What a night it has been.
There to the left.
He had only one night more to live.
Go to your father.
How much have you got?
At last we have a man.
It will be too late.
No, said her father.
Cut your hand open?
But it is all all too late now.
You are sure of it?
Have you found it?
Let me out.
Watch him, he said.
No, that can never be.
Tell her to begin.
Well, read the letter again.
Stop, let me show you the way.
Where could you keep it?
Give me the letter.
Do you know what he did last night?
This is real.
And what did you learn from him?
You will answer for it.
Why do you stop here?
That was the first night.
He is at sea.
A call for help, you thought?
Do you hear me?
They dont know their own country.
They are always the same.
The sun had set long since.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Point it at his horse.
They are hard at it.
Let me have a word with you.
It was very hard.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Who let you in?
But are you sure of that?
There was no letter for me.
Who was the letter from?
What is life to you?
You should take me there one day.
Keep watch all night.
You must walk.
She is still here?
