She got her hand free.
What has he done?
This is a test.
Oh, that.
He saw nothing.
Then it is certain?
Then he must be a wonder.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
It has to be done.
You know nothing about it.
Nothing could be more simple.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
All of this was possible.
Play the game out.
Of course they will.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
This made him wonder more and more.
Did he fall?
Yes, it is true.
Well, sit down by me.
Just let us go free.
Where can you wait for me?
Clear the table.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
It is a real bed.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Perhaps he did.
He is among us.
Wait and see.
Let me see your plan.
Yes, she could sing that.
Dont laugh.
The water ran dry.
Wait for me.
Of course he was right.
What can be done?
What kind of voice is it?
You must stay with me.
Yes, that is true.
Oh, nothing.
There is your old bed.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Did she stay long?
If you fall dont wait to get up.
And what have you done to me?
I hear his voice in the house.
You know you must say yes.
Keep clear of him.
Oh, to be sure.
Oh, of course.
Now we must wait.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
They call him a fine boy.
Come, and we can rest together.
Well then, be quick.
Well yes, you are right.
It was right in front of us.
His will be done.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Wonder if he has a name.
He has a good voice still.
Good to rest once in a way.
My mind is made up.
Which box do you mean?
It might have done me good.
Well, what does that lead up to?
You could see there was a story behind it.
She was still game.
Yes, my love?
There is a lot of people.
It was done.
It was brought to me.
Just go to sleep.
Yes, he said, all of it.
There, by the wheel.
A fine thing too.
Lead me to him.
His plan is very simple.
That was well done.
Bring this with you.
And what a voice she has.
He began to laugh.
Nothing is more simple.
In a minute.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
It is no use, said a voice.
Stay where you are.
Oh, take those off.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Is that a fact?
What is done is done.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Are you strong?
Of course it is.
You must stay.
Sit down, he said.
But what then must be done?
Behind my bed.
No, nothing at all.
It was a very dark night.
He will sleep an hour.
We are free to act and think.
He brought it with him for us to see.
What a game.
Free to do what?
It must be done at once.
It must be done.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Are they on foot?
No, nothing of the kind.
The city was soon behind me.
Oh, how can you sleep?
There is nothing more to be said.
Is it certain?
Oh, do as you like.
And he told you nothing?
How can a little dog laugh?
It was full of people.
He must be in the same boat as us.
Nothing could have been better.
Yes, once.
They need a rest.
The old man gave no answer.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Answer me that, miss.
Go in there and drive them out.
Well, of course.
Oh, dont ask me.
And then the game began all over again.
You will fall.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
There is no possible way.
Never mind how he came here.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Help me sit up.
It is nothing.
The night was dark.
But how long ago?
It is time for bed.
Then lead the way.
Who gave it to you?
It is done.
He knew nothing.
Oh, he is so kind.
Behind every book is a man.
Half the town was there.
But it must be done soon.
Fine, very fine.
Better sit still.
It is all done.
Yes, and no.
It stood behind the door.
Nothing had come of it.
Never mind that.
Oh, take me with you.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Then all was dark again.
Why should my father fly?
Oh, do you know?
And here is the note.
Yes, she said.
It is his voice.
The island was a mile long.
Like these in shape and size?
She heard and saw nothing.
It was a warm night.
It was a kind of language between us.
She gave me her hand.
But that is nothing to us.
My mind was soon made up.
He was here a minute ago.
Wait a second.
Of course she will.
He must wait.
It was very dark.
Yes, there it is.
Oh, no.
Never mind me.
Decide if you are going back home.
Oh, you are there.
He had made up his mind.
Money is no object?
Yes, very well.
Who brought you up?
How long ago?
Money is power.
What have they done with my work?
Nothing new under the sun.
He is in the box.
You are free to do so.
Yes, go on.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Why, of course.
Oh, that is very simple.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Did she fall?
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
At his side was a large green box.
Be back in a minute.
Wonder what he does.
It was cold and dark.
Oh, just listen.
Well, there he stood.
Quick, friend, quick.
They know nothing about it.
He ran up to them.
It was hot.
Yes, sit down.
What age is he?
Is it possible?
And you can do nothing until then?
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
He gave me this paper.
Let him go free?
Wait a minute.
Yes, of course.
Did it all rest on me?
Come, let me show you my plan.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Again came the voice.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Yes, it did.
Get to bed.
What brought you here?
Why did you bring him here?
What have you done?
Yes, to be sure.
He stood up.
Can it be possible?
It was so long ago.
If only they would be quick.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
See what you have done.
Do you see that island?
And yet you are the better off?
Do you have my note?
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Yes, what is it?
Oh, this is too much.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Is my father in town?
Oh, man.
You knew it, and said nothing?
Bring them here.
It was a cold, dark night.
Let her wait.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Wonder is it like that.
This voice was that of my father.
How was that possible?
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
The night was very dark.
You better stay here all night.
Hold on a minute.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
How was it done?
Yes, all right.
Oh let me in.
What did the letter contain?
His first cry was for his father.
Yes, but what did she say?
But wait a minute.
Yes, he said.
What has brought you here?
You brought no one with you?
Why does the boat go so fast?
Oh, come now.
But what must be done?
and so he decide he go back home.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Of course it might.
It is very clear.
It was so very long ago.
The whole day had been hot.
But she is nothing to me now.
It is certain.
Yes, he did.
Oh, very well, he said.
Look at that dark water.
Nothing she can eat?
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Yes and no.
He never said nothing.
He had, to be sure, done much.
He left long ago.
That is possible.
We must be quick.
Oh, do the best you can.
But they could see nothing.
There was more to be done.
Clear the way.
Come quick.
Go back to bed.
Oh, all right.
And sit in the dark?
She began to cry.
You can hear that, miss?
Oh, but you were there?
How is that done?
Try to sleep.
You can sleep here.
Take good note of it.
Oh, if men only knew.
Yes, that was a picture book.
We brought them in.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Laugh, if you will.
Well, miss?
Oh, go on.
Yes, we know that.
Fly, my friend.
Clear my name.
Is he in bed?
Leave the rest to me.
You must have a rest.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Let us sit down.
Very well, wait a minute.
Yes, she was back.
Well, sit down.
Yes, you are right.
Yes, go and find out.
Sit down, said the old man.
What have they done?
Then bring them to me, she said.
Here is our plan.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Yes, said the old man.
All right then, sit down.
The snow is deep.
You are in my power.
Oh, tell me.
The little boy lay in his bed.
What is power?
It was a dark night.
Go and rest.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Bring it here.
But let us see your plan.
Do you talk in your sleep?
It is possible.
It was a record run.
How long would you keep me in town?
Is that possible?
Wait for me here, all of you.
All that for nothing?
They would cry.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
That would be a fine thing.
is it come yet?
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Well, what about my plan?
We are more strong together.
But never mind that.
And yet you said he had money.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
In that town there is a street.
There is no one in that room behind you.
You love a certain person.
They all fall to the ground.
Nothing at all.
What more is to be done?
That is a fact.
Her voice was low.
Will you rest here a little?
All was dark.
