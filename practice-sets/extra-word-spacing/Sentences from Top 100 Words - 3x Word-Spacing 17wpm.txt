But what is it?
Is it time?
what is it?
And could she see him?
Would you do what he did?
Go on, he said.
So it is.
Look over it.
No one will come, she said.
And what is that?
How can it be?
Out of the way.
But what have they been up to?
You may go.
And who was that?
And what did you see?
Then how many are there?
Do you know him?
Look at them.
Do you see it?
Is that it?
What can we do, then?
The time will come.
When is it?
Who are you?
Then, how do you know?
There he is, she said.
Now what are we to do with you?
There is but one thing to do.
But he had to have it.
She has it.
And what do you call her?
What other way is there to look at it?
But how is that?
May we come in?
Then make it up.
What have you come for?
What would she have said?
And all for what?
Is that all?
Do as you will.
Do they know him?
but there was more to it than this.
What is it all about?
Look at it this way.
Can it be?
But so it is.
Is he there?
Now is your time.
Is it over?
Do you know what you look like?
And what did you do then?
What DO you know of him?
Call him in.
Is she like him?
They said no more.
Who was that?
You have it.
And what was it for?
What are we to do?
There were two of them.
Are you there?
What did you do then?
And has it come to this?
How can you know?
are you there?
You can do it.
but what if it is?
There he is, you see.
What do you make of it?
How long has he been there?
And who are you?
You know more than we do.
What is it about?
We have no water.
And do you like him?
What do you see?
You know how it is with her.
At what time?
What was it about?
Then there is more to do.
Did you see it?
So be it.
That will do, said he.
There you are, he said.
But he had no time.
It was from you.
What can this be?
No was there one?
Come this way.
what has she to do with it?
Which is it?
He said no.
But when will that be?
But what are you up to?
That will do, he said.
What is he like?
Then what is it?
What time is it?
Now there is no more to be said.
What could it be?
But how about you?
How is he now?
So there it was.
So that was the way.
But will he see it?
Tqhen you may go.
What is it for?
How was that?
But it has been so long.
You can go.
There he is, do you see him?
And how did you find out?
And when will you call?
And do you like her?
Then who are you?
There they are.
What is that?
and so on, and so on.
One or two?
Now you know.
And who is this?
Look at it.
How would you like to have it?
Had to look the other way.
Do you know what it is?
So it was.
Do as you like.
What was he like?
Do you like him?
Is that her?
Who was he?
Do you see him?
That was all she said.
What will you do, then?
Did you know her?
Will you come and see her?
How do you do?
Did you see her?
Will that do?
Is it like him?
who can it be?
We have him.
What is there to see?
And is that all?
And what do you make of it?
Who will go first?
What is it like?
Who and what are you?
Who is she?
Can one see from there?
But what will you do?
There you are.
What do you make of that?
who, then, are you?
How did you come by it?
How is she?
But who was she?
but we can go and see.
But WHAT DID you see?
When was it?
Do you know?
What did they do?
At what number?
What did he do to you?
But it was of no use.
How are you?
How did she do it?
Did you know him?
What was it?
How did you know about it?
That is what she did.
Would you like some?
How is he?
Or so they said.
You have them?
That is a long time.
The time had come.
Can you do that?
When was that?
Then what are you up to now?
What is all this?
What are you up to?
You can have some.
What do they call you?
Look at him.
Do you know her?
Has it come to this?
Did you know them?
How did he do it?
That was it.
What can this be?
Look over it.
Did you know them?
Who was that?
Or so they said.
Do you know?
What was he like?
Is it over?
what has she to do with it?
but there was more to it than this.
And do you like her?
But so it is.
Come this way.
Do you like him?
When was it?
No one will come, she said.
Do they know him?
Do you know her?
Is he there?
Then make it up.
Is it time?
Had to look the other way.
But it was of no use.
What do they call you?
who can it be?
That was all she said.
The time will come.
Will that do?
Look at it this way.
You can have some.
What will you do, then?
But will he see it?
Do as you will.
Would you do what he did?
Can you do that?
But how about you?
What DO you know of him?
There you are.
You know more than we do.
Will you come and see her?
Then who are you?
Can one see from there?
Can it be?
How can you know?
Did you know her?
But what is it?
She has it.
That is what she did.
But WHAT DID you see?
But what will you do?

How are you?
And what did you do then?
What is it like?
There were two of them.
You can go.
There you are, he said.
And is that all?
Who and what are you?
How is he?
Do as you like.
But what have they been up to?
There he is, she said.
What is all this?
What do you make of it?
So there it was.
Would you like some?
What is it for?
There they are.
Then there is more to do.
Is it like him?
What other way is there to look at it?
And has it come to this?
And what was it for?
At what number?
He said no.
How do you do?
Look at him.
That was it.
Now you know.
Now what are we to do with you?
Now there is no more to be said.
May we come in?
Then what are you up to now?
But who was she?
That is a long time.
It was from you.
Who was he?
Is that it?
Did you see her?
We have no water.

What is it all about?
And could she see him?
So be it.
At what time?
How can it be?
Who is she?
Then, how do you know?
Then what is it?
But it has been so long.
There he is, do you see him?
What do you see?
What is that?
But when will that be?
How is she?
Do you see it?
So it is.
What was it?
But he had no time.
What do you make of that?
and so on, and so on.
Now is your time.
