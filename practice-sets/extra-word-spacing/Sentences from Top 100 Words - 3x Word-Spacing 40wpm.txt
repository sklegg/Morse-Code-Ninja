But who was she?
And when will you call?
How can you know?
Now is your time.
Then what is it?
And who was that?
So be it.
So that was the way.
Do you like him?
That is what she did.
Or so they said.
But he had no time.
What are we to do?
Do as you like.
Look at him.
He said no.
Is that her?
What other way is there to look at it?
There he is, she said.
The time had come.
But it was of no use.
Can it be?
You have them?
Who will go first?
When is it?
How do you do?
How is he?
And is that all?
What have you come for?
There were two of them.
But it has been so long.
What would she have said?
You can have some.
The time will come.
Is that all?
who can it be?
what has she to do with it?
Did you know him?
What is it like?
What do you make of that?
Then who are you?
But how is that?
Who was that?
What did you do then?
And what do you make of it?
Who is she?
Is it over?
You can do it.
What was it?
What was he like?
You can go.
How is she?
Do you know her?
It was from you.
Do you know what it is?
How did you come by it?
But WHAT DID you see?
And what did you see?
And what do you call her?
Is he there?
What was it about?
Then how many are there?
But what will you do?
Do as you will.
Come this way.
That was all she said.
You may go.
What did he do to you?
Did you know her?
What can we do, then?
Who was he?
What is it for?
And who are you?
Are you there?
Is she like him?
You know more than we do.
No one will come, she said.
Had to look the other way.
And do you like him?
Do you see him?
When was it?
Then, how do you know?
How was that?
Do you know what you look like?
But will he see it?
What will you do, then?
Go on, he said.
Can you do that?
Then there is more to do.
You have it.
That is a long time.
Look over it.
Did you see her?
Will you come and see her?
who, then, are you?
How are you?
And do you like her?
May we come in?
That was it.
One or two?
And what was it for?
We have him.
Has it come to this?
There they are.
Now there is no more to be said.
How is he now?
No was there one?
Did you know them?
Would you like some?
Is it like him?
How did you know about it?
Then make it up.
but we can go and see.
Do you see it?
They said no more.
Look at it.
Do you know?
And has it come to this?
Can one see from there?
That will do, he said.
Call him in.
At what number?
But so it is.
what is it?
What do they call you?
There he is, you see.
Do they know him?
But when will that be?
Look at it this way.
And how did you find out?
We have no water.
Tqhen you may go.
What is that?
You know how it is with her.
What is he like?
So it is.
Is that it?
But what are you up to?
And could she see him?
At what time?
Who are you?
And what did you do then?
Is it time?
but what if it is?
Do you know him?
Out of the way.
What DO you know of him?
What do you see?
Look at them.
That will do, said he.
And all for what?
There he is, do you see him?
What is it all about?
So it was.
How would you like to have it?
And what is that?
and so on, and so on.
What are you up to?
What do you make of it?
Will that do?
What time is it?
How did she do it?
Which is it?
But what have they been up to?
What is there to see?
Now you know.
are you there?
What can this be?
Now what are we to do with you?
Did you see it?
How long has he been there?
What is all this?
Then what are you up to now?
How can it be?
Who and what are you?
Would you do what he did?
She has it.
When was that?
And who is this?
There you are, he said.
What is it about?
What did they do?
There is but one thing to do.
But he had to have it.
But how about you?
So there it was.
But what is it?
but there was more to it than this.
How did he do it?
There you are.
What could it be?
What can this be?
Which is it?
But it has been so long.
When is it?
But who was she?
You can do it.
Is it time?
But how about you?
Did you see her?
How can you know?
Do as you will.
How can it be?
Do they know him?
Look over it.
Do you know what you look like?
The time will come.
And do you like him?
There you are.
That will do, he said.
What could it be?
But what is it?
And who are you?
We have him.
What was he like?
Who will go first?
Who was he?
Then, how do you know?
But what will you do?
Did you know them?
Then there is more to do.
No one will come, she said.
So that was the way.
Is that it?
What is it all about?
What was it?
What do you make of that?
what is it?
We have no water.
There he is, she said.
Look at him.
But will he see it?
What do you make of it?
And what did you see?
Then what is it?
are you there?
That was all she said.
Now there is no more to be said.
But what are you up to?
Look at it this way.
Can you do that?
but we can go and see.
What will you do, then?
What is it about?
One or two?
But WHAT DID you see?
And is that all?
There he is, you see.
How is he now?
who, then, are you?
What did he do to you?
Did you see it?
You can have some.
There they are.
What have you come for?
Now you know.
That will do, said he.
What do you see?
There he is, do you see him?
How did she do it?
You have it.
The time had come.
what has she to do with it?
Do you see him?
Had to look the other way.
He said no.
What is it like?
There were two of them.
Can one see from there?
How are you?
It was from you.
But he had no time.
So it is.
And who is this?
Did you know her?
Tqhen you may go.
Is she like him?
You know more than we do.
Then how many are there?
How did he do it?
What time is it?
That is a long time.
There is but one thing to do.
But so it is.
But it was of no use.
How did you come by it?
Would you like some?
No was there one?
At what time?
What are you up to?
You know how it is with her.
Do you know him?
That is what she did.
And what was it for?
Is it over?
Who and what are you?
Now is your time.
Now what are we to do with you?
Then who are you?
And what did you do then?
How is she?
Go on, he said.
Is that her?
but there was more to it than this.
Then what are you up to now?
And all for what?
Come this way.
How did you know about it?
Will that do?
Is it like him?
Call him in.
They said no more.
Look at it.
What is that?
Did you know him?
How would you like to have it?
How do you do?
But he had to have it.
So there it was.
What is there to see?
And do you like her?
When was that?
May we come in?
and so on, and so on.
There you are, he said.
That was it.
What was it about?
And when will you call?
She has it.
So be it.
And what is that?
Would you do what he did?
Do you know?
How is he?
What did you do then?
What is all this?
What is it for?
Then make it up.
And what do you call her?
Do you know her?
When was it?
What other way is there to look at it?
And who was that?
Are you there?
but what if it is?
You can go.
Who is she?
What do they call you?
What would she have said?
So it was.
What are we to do?
Who was that?
At what number?
And could she see him?
And has it come to this?
But what have they been up to?
who can it be?
And how did you find out?
Do you like him?
Or so they said.
But how is that?
What DO you know of him?
But when will that be?
Is he there?
And what do you make of it?
How was that?
You have them?
Who are you?
Out of the way.
Look at them.
Do you know what it is?
Do you see it?
How long has he been there?
What is he like?
Do as you like.
Will you come and see her?
Has it come to this?
Is that all?
Can it be?
What did they do?
You may go.
What can we do, then?
