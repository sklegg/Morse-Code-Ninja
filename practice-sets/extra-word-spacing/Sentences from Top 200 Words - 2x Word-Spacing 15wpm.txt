But this is the point.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
What do you want?
He will live.
You will get on in the world.
There she is again.
How much are they?
What is your name?
What was his name?
where did she come from?
Well then, what do you want?
Where could he be?
She has a house?
Well, here he is.
What does he mean?
And it did me good.
How did you get me out?
They want more.
But where is he?
Here it is, he said.
No, tell me.
Look at me.
Why, what do you mean?
Will you try?
Well, how did it go?
What do you play?
How do you take it?
How can you find out?
Is there no one who can help me?
What do you think of him?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Is it any good?
Have you been here long?
Read that, she said.
Where have they been?
Well, what do you think about it?
At your house?
Who is that man?
How long have you been here?
How does he use it?
Well, all right.
And what do you think?
Where are you from?
That would be very good.
Play with them.
Who will tell her?
No, mother.
What will each of you give?
And they went home.
Are you here for good?
Were you here before me?
They had all been very good to us.
And have you been here long?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
What did you say your name was?
Much good that would be.
She came up to them.
Come with me.
Say no more.
Here is the way we put in the time.
Go and try.
How much do you want?
You must take me with you.
Give it me.
Why do you want to know?
Show it to me.
Is it all right?
take them all.
Is she well?
This is my point.
Tell me who made the world.
The first act was over.
Do you want me to do it?
We are who we say we are.
Are you back again?
Well, read it.
And how old were you at that time?
What you have just said is good, very good.
Come and help me.
Try it on.
Is this the man?
What is that in your hand?
Why is that?
What could set you off in the first place?
Say no more about it.
Now where did they come from?
That was a good time.
It must be where you put it.
There, that does me good.
What do you think of that?
What on earth do you mean?
We will say no more about it, then.
How can you think of such a thing?
Where are we?
When will her mother come?
What did you say that for?
Give me my work.
Is he a good man?
It was high time.
Do you think she was?
For how much?
All right, then.
There is more to tell.
He went on his way.
Who are these men?
Get out and play.
Now we see the light.
How did that help you?
Turn this way.
And why is that?
Do it for me.
He was here.
Is that right?
Good day, one and all.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Do you think so?
He has more to give.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Move on, then.
Take some, she said.
And where is she, then?
Tell me about it.
But why do you ask?
Where does he live?
How could she say such a thing.
Where is she?
That is right.
What on earth does this mean?
How on earth do you know?
How does she use you?
But why do you ask me?
Come with me to the little house.
What do you mean by that?
You can help me here.
Give me your hand.
Well, did he?
Then why are you here?
What does she want?
Three, he said.
How can you say that?
And what are they made of?
When will it take place?
What do they want?
You are a good boy.
Well, tell me.
Then what kind is it?
Can you help me find my way?
How can you tell?
Very well, show him to me.
Look at it other way round.
See, they are here.
For some man.
She was right.
Take this and this.
What do you want to ask these people?
What was it you said to me?
Now, go home.
That was very good.
He went to him.
Can you point it out to me?
He will ask for it.
Where are you?
Show me the way.
You must tell me.
And what did he say?
Well, go on.
Would you now like to look round my place?
Where is he now?
Where is he?
Do you think so now?
And what about your mother?
Come with me, then.
Ask her, he said.
What did he say?
Very well, he said.
And off we go.
That is right, said the old man.
He was so kind.
Here is my hand.
She was the cause of it all.
What have you been after?
Is he big?
It is very high.
Time to get out.
Why do you want water?
How did you get here?
Now come here.
What do you want me to do?
Where are you off to?
Do you know me?
You think so?
But what does it mean?
Large or small?
Just look through it.
All in good time.
How old was she?
This is the man.
What would you have me do?
Get out of the way.
What do you think of her?
He was at work again.
There is no place like home.
Is it you or me?
Think no more about that.
Where did he come from?
And that was the end of it.
Read that, he said.
do you come from the end of the world?
What a good thing it would be.
In what part of the house?
There will just be time.
Well then, tell him so.
Why is he here?
Just like me.
It is all the same.
But who was your mother?
But where are we to go?
Are you at it again?
That is the end of her.
And where is this man?
Here she is.
And where was the place?
How old are you?
Tell me his name.
Call me what you will, he said.
Think of him.
There was no one near.
And what is her name?
There is no one here to see.
To what end?
Think what you will.
Then will come our time.
What do you mean?
Just look at her.
And a very good thing, too.
What do you think of this?
What will you say?
Give me a light.
Give it to me, then.
Now, you know me.
There was work to do.
Now it was time to act.
Why, what is it, then?
Too much for me now.
She went on.
Tell us all about it.
Only two there now.
Too much in the way.
Now tell me.
What could she mean by it?
And how did you find out?
You must come now.
The world is before you.
Ask him to show up?
I would like to see her again in that.
Good day to you.
You see it every day.
Why are you like this?
We must come back.
Are they like each other?
Where have you been?
And what will they do with us?
She had to tell him.
What did he tell you?
Where are they off to now?
That is just my point.
And what did she say?
What does it all mean?
This is the first act.
This for me?
But what about me?
Can you take me?
And where is he now?
And do you know why?
It is very kind of you.
What more could a man ask for?
Where do you live?
Think it over.
Will you come with me?
Where are we to turn for help?
Good, he said.
What is in your hand?
She has been with him many long years.
this one, too?
What does one live for?
And in she went.
Tell me all about it.
But what did you want?
After three, he said.
Such as what?
Give him air.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Well, and what do you think?
What do they say was the cause?
Here it is.
Will you take me to her?
And how in the world did you find them?
That was a house to look at.
If you want to know, go and find out.
Where in the world did you come from?
Why did he come?
Which house is it?
And who is the man?
Well, and is that all?
See, here it is.
It would be very kind of you.
Get to work.
You can say what it is.
Been back long?
Did you tell him?
You are right.
They are here.
And where is it?
What does all this mean?
What is his name?
Too much of this.
Tell us your name.
Some day you may ask me about it.
You were near him.
Show me the way he went.
It was now his turn to look about him.
One, two, three.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
But he does so need a mother.
He said too much.
Where to, now?
It is the same thing.
Very well then.
But he is right.
But it is just so with the world.
What does she think about me?
But where is it?
You know, you see right through people.
You are most kind.
And what was his name?
Is it as good now?
That is all one can say about her.
Well, how are you?
Give me more than that
He was there too.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
There is the little boy.
Now, what do you want with me?
In what year?
Well, what do you think?
Hand it in.
Is it large?
He said that that would help.
Where did you place it?
Say what you want.
Where do they get that?
But you must.
You are all very kind to me.
there are only two.
Why are you here?
It is great.
Why are they here?
He is at my house.
It will take a little time.
When will he come back?
Put it on.
You think so, too?
Then they will follow you?
We are here.
Is that all you want?
Is there some for me?
Follow me, said the man.
