Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
We may be too late.
Then, good night.
Did you see his eye?
So, once more, good night.
Who let you in?
Is it far?
Come, let us be men.
And she left the room.
She saw no one?
No, that can never be.
Why dont you play?
Let me hear what it is.
Cut your hand open?
Well, what next?
That is the idea.
Dont you see that?
There is only food for one.
But let us walk.
Just cut it out.
It will be too late.
It might help.
Let me out.
You saw him?
Who did you learn that from?
Take care.
This is real.
Is that far?
Ask one of those men.
It was white.
They came over last night.
Any book will tell you that.
But what did you hear?
At this time of my life, no.
Are you sure of it?
Now let me have it.
But then you would be close to the sea?
He saw his men draw back.
She is my friend.
So it always was.
He has children of his own.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
But now it is too late.
Let me say one thing.
Let me get on with my work.
Can you hear me?
She must have a hard time with him.
They dont care.
Who took him out of it?
Have you never been there?
Does he never go out?
it took all that time to come over the water.
Why, dont you hear it?
He had only one night more to live.
My father is right.
Let me have a word with you.
Just cut it out, will you?
We must begin again.
But it would be in the paper.
Sure of what?
He came at once.
Well, read the letter again.
Why, is it late?
Let us go in.
No, said her father.
Do you want some more to eat?
Let her go.
It was like new life to him.
Cut him down.
One night more and he would be on his way.
You must never tell.
That was the first night.
How much have you got?
He is at sea.
We got to let that go.
So he began to help.
We got one and they got one.
Why dont you want to go?
She saw it.
What did you hear?
Good night again.
One never has too much.
Will you never learn?
What was the name of the man who took it?
We should ask him.
She might be at his house.
Let him follow me.
He has been been found.
Do you have a car?
Let me hear your story.
How could you begin?
We are together.
Here we see the boy at school.
Say good night.
No, stop.
And who is this friend?
First turn to the left.
Do we stop here?
Dont say that to me.
It would seem so.
That night we were just in time.
And then they began to fish.
Who was the letter from?
We were together.
Here is the book.
Point it at his horse.
He then said, It is time to start.
We found it.
There was no letter for me.
Good for the country.
He is my friend.
At four, she said.
Just a few.
No, dont.
And this food?
If you know, why dont you tell?
He is my father.
Let me know at once when you will start.
What a start that was.
We might learn a thing or two.
You must walk.
Tell me more.
Good night, friend.
How would they stop it?
Life is all right.
See him grow up.
Still, you never know.
So they got out and went in.
Here is the letter.
Keep to the left.
And then we may begin.
She never came back.
What would you have me do with my life?
Do you know what he did last night?
Why should this be so?
The other night she left.
Let us start, then.
Well, run back to her.
But you got to play music for them.
Come let us see them.
Take care of him.
Have you found it?
Come at once.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Who found them out?
What should he say?
Let me go back.
What is life to you?
He said at last.
Let me look.
They are hard at it.
For once you are right.
Then let me have a word with you.
He may come close.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Watch him, he said.
Who said four?
Is there any answer?
Have you got it?
What did he answer?
In the country?
How many children?
Dont you want any?
They dont know their own country.
You took it.
Do you often come back?
Is he a real father?
Right here it began.
Go to your father.
Let me in.
Let me see him at once.
You got me?
When did you begin?
Think of my father.
Are we too late?
Now or never.
It is open?
Our own people must come first.
You must eat now.
Where is the river?
Where have you been this long while?
This is my country.
She is still here?
This took place at his house, in his room.
Come eat with me.
At last we have a man.
We got under way at last.
Never see him again.
Give me the letter.
Where is this city?
It was very hard.
Which story was it?
It was the last day of the year.
What a night it has been.
It was his own room.
There are only four of us.
Can you stand?
It is well thought of.
Come here, my friend.
It was then time to start.
Dont tell me.
A second man got up and went out.
It is from your father.
This is what began it all.
Why should they?
And there are four of you?
Let me be and let me live.
One of us will be here all night.
One was on a white horse.
Do you know how he made his mark?
You found him?
Music is a good thing.
Is it in the city?
A call for help, you thought?
Off with his head.
And what did you do with that letter?
He had no idea how long he had been there.
It is always so.
They never come back.
But it is the same with any life.
How many are left?
What country does he come from?
Stop, said he.
But then it will be too late.
He had two left feet.
What do you think when you hear music?
It is so very kind of you both.
Who could have thought it?
You have a car?
It was the first thing he thought of.
Dont you like it?
Well, let us be sure of that.
You must study.
Let me go to the door.
Stop and think.
Do you want to cross?
Are you my friend?
But why dont you want to take it?
You might want it.
Do you hear that?
Why is he cross with me?
Now you must eat.
You are sure of it?
Was you in my room?
There were few near me.
Off with her head.
It is a long story.
We are very far from that.
What do you hear?
Always the same with you people.
Who can answer for that?
Let them have it.
But are you sure of that?
We never thought of that.
By and by he got it.
Who should it be?
Open the door.
He could run no more.
Only, dont look back.
But watch over him.
No, why should he?
Let me see her.
Watch over him.
Come over in the sun.
Here is the paper.
And he left the room.
Dont move, he said.
Let us go back.
Do you know where he is?
He might still be up.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Write an answer.
The sun had set long since.
What do you think of the music?
And what did you learn from him?
The children will live just the same.
They never did it again.
We must go at once.
Do you hear me?
There was no answer.
They always know.
But it is all all too late now.
Stop, let me show you the way.
Let us cross over.
Do you have the letter?
Let him answer us.
Both of us.
Let me see it.
Why do you stop here?
You are right, father.
What was left of him?
How could you let him go so far?
It is music.
Are you sure?
No, said the Tree.
This took him some time.
Few had found it.
She got up.
Here he is at last.
Tell us a story.
Where could you keep it?
Let him grow up with you.
But hard to tell.
And your children?
Have you been at sea?
She came over last night.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
You will answer for it.
Is my father here?
Which end is his head?
She came in just now by the back door.
Call the next one.
Look at his face.
What was it that you thought?
What is your real name?
They are always the same.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
what river is it?
We dont see it like that.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Let me see him.
There to the left.
You are sure of that?
But take care.
How did it begin?
And why should they?
But she saw no one?
No, never.
Let me get to work.
So take care of me.
But it was very late.
What did he say in the letter?
Have you got that?
To the left.
Tell her to begin.
Dont you think so?
Are we late?
Where has she run off to?
Keep watch all night.
You should take me there one day.
These were the first people we saw.
He is always at it.
We should look at this.
And now, good night.
There, do you hear?
But you must never tell.
Always the same, year after year.
It must be in her own house.
And now let us go home.
They may tell us to open it.
But they may still come here.
Keep to the right.
Why, it was one of his own men.
