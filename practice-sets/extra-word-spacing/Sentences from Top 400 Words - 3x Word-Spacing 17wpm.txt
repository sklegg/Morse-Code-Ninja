Her only thought was to reach his side.
How do you feel now?
She was a good girl.
Had you heard?
How far from the body?
What have you heard?
Where did they get the money from?
You must leave that to me.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
So the question was, what to do?
This is simple.
Is the wind north or south?
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Are you still cold?
You are on a ship?
you should know her better than me.
It is a rock.
She must be told.
Now listen to me.
He is very simple.
You know me well enough.
It is a young girl.
She is much better.
Who told you that?
you must step out.
They had several children.
He said, the work is now complete.
The family was at home.
They knew it.
An hour and a half.
Let us talk about you.
We had a list.
But listen to this, he said.
Has she any family?
Leave off that.
No more money?
She was so young, too.
Do you remember?
Leave any for him?
This will pass in no time.
Why talk to me?
Never heard of him.
Better write it here.
No, my love.
Never heard of it before.
It would have been more simple.
And what does she want the money for?
But enough of this.
Where he was, no one knew.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Let me hear from you soon.
You had better go.
That would be the best way.
Where are you off to so early?
Who told you so?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
But he never heard me.
And so they began to talk.
It is the rule.
You must travel.
He will leave me.
He got it this morning.
It can never happen.
That is enough.
Feel better then.
In short, take me.
Why do you serve?
Your watch is slow.
Is your family well?
What kind of a bird?
Did he though?
And then he told all he knew.
And you will always love him?
About the usual time.
One other question, said he.
But let that pass.
And so they knew that it was true.
A better man than you.
They left in the morning.
He never heard.
What do you mean by that question?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
That was the question.
Who was it told me his name?
We knew them both.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Listen to this, will you?
Have you told her?
So do you, my love.
You were told.
Then you will know me better.
Before you leave, tell us.
Are you better?
Every word you said was heard.
A young man?
You can pass through the door.
Do you love her much?
Let me remember what he said.
It would be better if you went to the war.
Long live the king.
Is it true?
To know her is to love her.
She is the first person in this house.
He never told us what it was she said.
You are cold.
They can have all our half of the house.
You are in love with me?
Take good care of the little girl.
Little girl, where have you been?
It will interest you, said he.
Can she sing?
Young man, you will go far.
Remember that time?
Then what would happen?
But she is very young.
Is your man white or black?
She told me to ask you.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
What does he feel?
And why do you serve?
But what did we ever get for it?
You will soon know.
I have no children to love me.
What size do you want?
Do you love me?
Hold it up to the light.
And will you direct us?
We were up early.
They had much to talk about.
Against what side?
We serve them.
She knew at once.
Why did it happen?
So we came down this road.
Do you own a dog?
The rock was very small.
We had better go in.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
You are right, young man.
It is true.
You have an hour.
You are a good girl.
Are you ready?
But listen to me.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
In an hour?
Take notice.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
She was only a little girl.
You saw the person?
He said, get him out of the road.
Look to the west.
The night was cold and still.
Keep in step.
you know better than that.
That may be true.
Do you want any money?
They all heard me.
It was all she could do to hold in.
How soon will he be here?
Let this man pass.
Did you get any money?
Are you in love with her?
Let me see him, said the young man.
Did you tell him your whole story?
Pass this way, then.
This was true.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Put down three and carry five.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Have you a family?
That must be true.
He put his hand over part of the map.
Are you ready to play?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
If you know it, that is enough.
They had heard all that before.
Half a mile?
On fire, on fire.
There are four hundred?
Let me also ask you a question.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
what could be better?
But how simple it is.
That was the rule, she said.
But one day you must feel it.
How many children did he leave?
Do you know that old lay?
You are better than that.
What will happen to us?
He knew them.
There was no wind.
Try it on the dog first.
And how did he make his money?
When do you leave?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
What is love?
Never heard of it.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
That is very simple.
Let us talk a little about my father.
And serve them right.
Are you all ready?
Made me feel so young.
We are ready.
Are they made to order?
How could that happen?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
We got her half way.
If you only knew.
What a question.
They told me to.
You are right, my love.
Light my fire.
You remember the place, my father?
This is my body.
That is true.
How does it feel?
Pull it more to your side.
Listen to me.
Which king?
From then on it was war between them.
Ten, did you say?
And you can sing?
Will you answer that question?
Are we ready?
Does he love you?
It has been there ever since.
Listen to him.
Are you here on leave?
Well, young man?
No, he is a man about my size.
It was cold.
Why do they want to make her sing?
How short his time.
It was true.
It is a fire.
Let that pass.
It was true to life.
He is better than any of you.
She is very plain.
And you are still so young.
She knew what was good for children.
Your true father?
Leave me out of the question.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Pull together.
He had my love.
Do you remember him?
The King Went to him.
Now, listen.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Does she go fast?
The world is big enough.
Can it be true?
You may leave the room.
You may go, said the King.
What can happen?
That is enough for me.
Take a hold of it.
What is there to talk about?
Much of it was true.
Did they ever go back?
Then get ready at once.
Five young children.
An example would be better.
What will happen now?
And dont talk to me.
Do you remember me?
It was a round table.
The night was cold.
Better cross here.
This money was for her.
Is that true?
She is fast?
He has money.
The dog is always with him.
Better late than never.
Had they been heard?
Have you heard?
He had enough of it.
We will talk about that.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
It is cold.
Hold her hand.
who told you you could?
Listen to them, he said.
You will always love him?
And that is the whole point.
No less, no more.
Fire and water, earth and air.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Let us pass.
Can you sing?
How does this happen?
What a state he was in.
When did this happen?
We dont know enough.
Long and the short of it.
Ten will be early enough.
Half as many is too much.
What have you against me now?
Have you heard from him often?
She told me all about it.
We must make the best of it.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
But why must you leave me so soon?
As soon as you left, it began.
You love him?
How did this happen?
They are still young.
Ask them to sing one more song.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
We call it black.
Well, are you ready?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
She had very little notice from him.
Let us leave them, she said.
A house is on fire?
Answer me this one question.
Read them, said the King.
Was he young or old?
How do you feel?
Why do we love?
