You had better go.
How soon will he be here?
Listen to him.
Let this man pass.
Listen to this, will you?
What have you against me now?
Read them, said the King.
You are a good girl.
But let that pass.
You can pass through the door.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
What a state he was in.
you should know her better than me.
A house is on fire?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Where did they get the money from?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Ten will be early enough.
They knew it.
You were told.
She is fast?
Pull it more to your side.
Leave any for him?
They told me to.
The dog is always with him.
You must travel.
And what does she want the money for?
No more money?
It was true to life.
She was so young, too.
What can happen?
You may leave the room.
You are on a ship?
We are ready.
He got it this morning.
Well, are you ready?
What kind of a bird?
How did this happen?
We were up early.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
If you know it, that is enough.
He never heard.
He knew them.
They had heard all that before.
A young man?
The rock was very small.
Never heard of it.
That is true.
Look to the west.
Are we ready?
Why do you serve?
Hold it up to the light.
Light my fire.
They are still young.
We got her half way.
He said, the work is now complete.
Let that pass.
It will interest you, said he.
What do you mean by that question?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Are you ready to play?
You love him?
Are you in love with her?
But enough of this.
It is a young girl.
Now, listen.
We dont know enough.
You are in love with me?
And you will always love him?
So we came down this road.
you must step out.
You are cold.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
And then he told all he knew.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Do you love me?
Listen to them, he said.
Better late than never.
When did this happen?
Better write it here.
He said, get him out of the road.
Is it true?
Answer me this one question.
As soon as you left, it began.
Half as many is too much.
Is the wind north or south?
It is cold.
We must make the best of it.
That must be true.
They had several children.
It was cold.
She had very little notice from him.
So do you, my love.
Let me hear from you soon.
The King Went to him.
Where he was, no one knew.
You are better than that.
An example would be better.
Let us talk about you.
Does he love you?
She was a good girl.
It was a round table.
You will soon know.
Fire and water, earth and air.
But why must you leave me so soon?
She is very plain.
who told you you could?
There was no wind.
Are you ready?
They left in the morning.
He is better than any of you.
On fire, on fire.
Little girl, where have you been?
Every word you said was heard.
And you can sing?
This is my body.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
You are right, my love.
And how did he make his money?
Against what side?
Ask them to sing one more song.
Can it be true?
How does it feel?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Do you remember me?
Why do they want to make her sing?
Now listen to me.
Are you here on leave?
what could be better?
And serve them right.
You must leave that to me.
How short his time.
No less, no more.
It has been there ever since.
Leave off that.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Then you will know me better.
How do you feel?
They all heard me.
It can never happen.
Is that true?
This is simple.
We had better go in.
That is enough for me.
She knew at once.
She told me to ask you.
He will leave me.
That would be the best way.
Was he young or old?
About the usual time.
Will you answer that question?
Half a mile?
Pass this way, then.
Do you own a dog?
Let us talk a little about my father.
you know better than that.
Made me feel so young.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Do you remember?
She was only a little girl.
Do you know that old lay?
One other question, said he.
Did they ever go back?
What will happen now?
And so they knew that it was true.
Your true father?
We knew them both.
That is enough.
What does he feel?
That was the rule, she said.
The family was at home.
And that is the whole point.
But listen to this, he said.
Had they been heard?
And why do you serve?
Better cross here.
How do you feel now?
That was the question.
In an hour?
Had you heard?
You may go, said the King.
Have you heard?
But what did we ever get for it?
Which king?
Do you love her much?
And you are still so young.
Never heard of him.
Have you told her?
We will talk about that.
There are four hundred?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
It was all she could do to hold in.
Why do we love?
In short, take me.
Who told you that?
Then get ready at once.
It is a fire.
You remember the place, my father?
She told me all about it.
What will happen to us?
He had my love.
Let me remember what he said.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
Much of it was true.
What is love?
From then on it was war between them.
You have an hour.
And so they began to talk.
This money was for her.
How could that happen?
It would have been more simple.
The night was cold and still.
This will pass in no time.
Why talk to me?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Take good care of the little girl.
Leave me out of the question.
They had much to talk about.
Do you remember him?
Did you tell him your whole story?
No, he is a man about my size.
When do you leave?
This was true.
That may be true.
Let us leave them, she said.
He is very simple.
And will you direct us?
Your watch is slow.
It would be better if you went to the war.
Why did it happen?
They can have all our half of the house.
Who was it told me his name?
Let me also ask you a question.
How many children did he leave?
You saw the person?
That is very simple.
She is much better.
Before you leave, tell us.
You are right, young man.
But one day you must feel it.
Listen to me.
No, my love.
To know her is to love her.
Keep in step.
Hold her hand.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Are you all ready?
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Is your family well?
If you only knew.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Has she any family?
Do you want any money?
He put his hand over part of the map.
Take notice.
She is the first person in this house.
Never heard of it before.
But she is very young.
He never told us what it was she said.
Well, young man?
We call it black.
But how simple it is.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
It is the rule.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
You know me well enough.
Does she go fast?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
The world is big enough.
She must be told.
Are they made to order?
We serve them.
Try it on the dog first.
Then what would happen?
It was true.
Pull together.
Ten, did you say?
What is there to talk about?
What size do you want?
How does this happen?
Are you better?
I have no children to love me.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Have you heard from him often?
He has money.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
We had a list.
Take a hold of it.
Let me see him, said the young man.
An hour and a half.
Feel better then.
Did he though?
Long live the king.
Let us pass.
Five young children.
So the question was, what to do?
Remember that time?
But listen to me.
Are you still cold?
And dont talk to me.
Did you get any money?
It is true.
Put down three and carry five.
It is a rock.
Where are you off to so early?
What have you heard?
Who told you so?
Can you sing?
Long and the short of it.
The night was cold.
Young man, you will go far.
How far from the body?
Can she sing?
He had enough of it.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
You will always love him?
But he never heard me.
Is your man white or black?
A better man than you.
What a question.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
She knew what was good for children.
Have you a family?
