Cut him down.
Can you hear me?
These were the first people we saw.
How many children?
Keep watch all night.
It was white.
There was no answer.
That was the first night.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
But let us walk.
Who should it be?
What did he answer?
You must never tell.
If you know, why dont you tell?
See him grow up.
Good for the country.
She is still here?
You are sure of it?
They came over last night.
They are always the same.
Always the same, year after year.
The other night she left.
Let me in.
By and by he got it.
But are you sure of that?
You found him?
Come here, my friend.
We might learn a thing or two.
Dont tell me.
what river is it?
And this food?
How much have you got?
And she left the room.
There were few near me.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
When did you begin?
Let us go in.
Here is the letter.
Have you never been there?
She saw no one?
Say good night.
What do you think when you hear music?
Keep to the right.
No, that can never be.
Dont move, he said.
Let me go to the door.
We never thought of that.
Well, let us be sure of that.
You will answer for it.
Good night again.
He is my friend.
And then we may begin.
No, said her father.
Who did you learn that from?
Cut your hand open?
So they got out and went in.
Life is all right.
Come let us see them.
One night more and he would be on his way.
We got one and they got one.
What was the name of the man who took it?
She got up.
Tell us a story.
What is your real name?
We should ask him.
They are hard at it.
Few had found it.
We are together.
What did you hear?
Let me see him at once.
Why, dont you hear it?
Always the same with you people.
Dont you want any?
Write an answer.
But take care.
Is it far?
No, said the Tree.
You saw him?
Do you know what he did last night?
Have you got that?
Both of us.
Here we see the boy at school.
But she saw no one?
Do you often come back?
What do you hear?
Did you see his eye?
Do you hear that?
And now, good night.
You got me?
But then it will be too late.
Why dont you want to go?
Let us cross over.
Have you found it?
They never did it again.
Come at once.
And who is this friend?
We must go at once.
At four, she said.
Stop, let me show you the way.
We must begin again.
So it always was.
But you got to play music for them.
It was the last day of the year.
Let me get on with my work.
We got to let that go.
Why do you stop here?
Off with his head.
Is my father here?
Off with her head.
You are sure of that?
But they may still come here.
Tell me more.
Who took him out of it?
Go to your father.
Will you never learn?
No, never.
One never has too much.
Who could have thought it?
It was the first thing he thought of.
No, dont.
Dont you think so?
It was like new life to him.
How did it begin?
It would seem so.
We found it.
It is from your father.
Take care.
Where is this city?
You must study.
There are only four of us.
But you must never tell.
She never came back.
He said at last.
There to the left.
But it was very late.
Watch him, he said.
Here is the book.
He is at sea.
What do you think of the music?
Was you in my room?
He had two left feet.
We are very far from that.
Now let me have it.
Are you sure?
The children will live just the same.
But why dont you want to take it?
Is that far?
No, stop.
You must eat now.
Tell her to begin.
Let me get to work.
Do you have a car?
For once you are right.
Come eat with me.
Which end is his head?
The sun had set long since.
Let them have it.
Let him answer us.
In the country?
He came at once.
She saw it.
You might want it.
Who found them out?
It is a long story.
Are we too late?
This is real.
To the left.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
There was no letter for me.
He has been been found.
It is music.
Do you know how he made his mark?
But hard to tell.
Is he a real father?
She is my friend.
But it is all all too late now.
Keep to the left.
Point it at his horse.
First turn to the left.
Then let me have a word with you.
We were together.
Where have you been this long while?
Let me out.
It was then time to start.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Who said four?
He is my father.
Now or never.
Where could you keep it?
Look at his face.
So, once more, good night.
It is open?
What was it that you thought?
He has children of his own.
Do you want some more to eat?
How many are left?
Let me hear what it is.
Why dont you play?
Who let you in?
Let me see it.
Dont you like it?
They always know.
Let her go.
Do you know where he is?
Take care of him.
Any book will tell you that.
My father is right.
Who can answer for that?
A call for help, you thought?
You must walk.
Only, dont look back.
This took him some time.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Why should this be so?
Do you hear me?
So take care of me.
Which story was it?
He could run no more.
A second man got up and went out.
Stop and think.
You took it.
One of us will be here all night.
So he began to help.
And why should they?
Just set still and take it like a man.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
How could you begin?
She must have a hard time with him.
Just a few.
Do we stop here?
He saw his men draw back.
Let us go back.
Well, run back to her.
Think of my father.
No, why should he?
Ask one of those men.
Our own people must come first.
We may be too late.
It was his own room.
Well, what next?
It must be in her own house.
Let me be and let me live.
Are you sure of it?
We should look at this.
Let me see her.
There is only food for one.
And what did you do with that letter?
Now you must eat.
What is life to you?
Where has she run off to?
That is the idea.
At this time of my life, no.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
They dont care.
Does he never go out?
Do you have the letter?
Dont you see that?
And then they began to fish.
She might be at his house.
He had only one night more to live.
Call the next one.
Watch over him.
Let me know at once when you will start.
They never come back.
Where is the river?
Just cut it out.
But it would be in the paper.
What did he say in the letter?
It is well thought of.
Still, you never know.
But watch over him.
At last we have a man.
It is so very kind of you both.
Let him follow me.
Is it in the city?
Why should they?
Let me hear your story.
Are you my friend?
Right here it began.
One was on a white horse.
How could you let him go so far?
She came in just now by the back door.
Let me have a word with you.
Have you got it?
There, do you hear?
What would you have me do with my life?
But now it is too late.
What was left of him?
You are right, father.
Let us start, then.
He might still be up.
Sure of what?
It was very hard.
Well, read the letter again.
Let me say one thing.
This is what began it all.
How would they stop it?
Do you want to cross?
But it is the same with any life.
Why, it was one of his own men.
What a night it has been.
it took all that time to come over the water.
What country does he come from?
They may tell us to open it.
And what did you learn from him?
He may come close.
Let me look.
Music is a good thing.
Let me see him.
And now let us go home.
Open the door.
Who was the letter from?
Is there any answer?
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
It will be too late.
It is always so.
Good night, friend.
Have you been at sea?
That night we were just in time.
And there are four of you?
He is always at it.
Why, is it late?
We dont see it like that.
Just cut it out, will you?
And your children?
And he left the room.
Here he is at last.
Dont say that to me.
She came over last night.
It might help.
But then you would be close to the sea?
Can you stand?
Stop, said he.
What should he say?
Are we late?
Here is the paper.
Let me go back.
He then said, It is time to start.
Never see him again.
Come over in the sun.
What a start that was.
Give me the letter.
They dont know their own country.
We got under way at last.
Come, let us be men.
Let him grow up with you.
You have a car?
But what did you hear?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
You should take me there one day.
Why is he cross with me?
This is my country.
Then, good night.
