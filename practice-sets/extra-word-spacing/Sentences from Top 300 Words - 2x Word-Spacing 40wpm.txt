This took him some time.
And now, good night.
But she saw no one?
One of us will be here all night.
Just cut it out.
We must go at once.
Keep to the right.
Why should this be so?
Come at once.
He might still be up.
But you got to play music for them.
Any book will tell you that.
Only, dont look back.
There is only food for one.
She came in just now by the back door.
Still, you never know.
Let us go in.
Why do you stop here?
Just cut it out, will you?
What is life to you?
Come let us see them.
It was very hard.
Let me get on with my work.
No, why should he?
Do we stop here?
But it is the same with any life.
Just a few.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Are you sure?
One night more and he would be on his way.
Where is this city?
Who took him out of it?
Good night, friend.
What is your real name?
it took all that time to come over the water.
We should look at this.
We may be too late.
Always the same, year after year.
He is my father.
Let me see him at once.
Well, run back to her.
Who did you learn that from?
You took it.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Which story was it?
Who could have thought it?
There were few near me.
Now you must eat.
Is there any answer?
He had only one night more to live.
No, that can never be.
Does he never go out?
Come, let us be men.
Cut him down.
Come here, my friend.
But let us walk.
So take care of me.
Have you been at sea?
First turn to the left.
That was the first night.
What did he say in the letter?
But it would be in the paper.
Let me see him.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Well, what next?
What a night it has been.
That is the idea.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
You saw him?
what river is it?
It will be too late.
They dont care.
Here is the letter.
Take care of him.
Dont you see that?
We might learn a thing or two.
How much have you got?
Is my father here?
Sure of what?
These were the first people we saw.
Did you see his eye?
He may come close.
Take care.
Let us go back.
Always the same with you people.
We are very far from that.
You are sure of that?
Are you sure of it?
Which end is his head?
Dont you want any?
It is a long story.
It must be in her own house.
Good for the country.
That night we were just in time.
You should take me there one day.
Never see him again.
Now let me have it.
You got me?
They came over last night.
She got up.
Our own people must come first.
We never thought of that.
Have you got that?
Do you know how he made his mark?
Who let you in?
Music is a good thing.
Let me go to the door.
Do you have the letter?
They never did it again.
How many children?
Do you hear that?
Cut your hand open?
And this food?
It is from your father.
We are together.
Let me hear what it is.
Think of my father.
Who was the letter from?
Was you in my room?
What a start that was.
What was left of him?
Why, dont you hear it?
He had two left feet.
This is real.
It is always so.
How could you let him go so far?
Tell her to begin.
Are we too late?
This is what began it all.
And what did you do with that letter?
We were together.
But are you sure of that?
Then let me have a word with you.
Have you found it?
Let us cross over.
And there are four of you?
She is still here?
What did he answer?
Here we see the boy at school.
We must begin again.
A call for help, you thought?
My father is right.
It was the last day of the year.
But then it will be too late.
Let me have a word with you.
Let them have it.
How could you begin?
Let him answer us.
Do you hear me?
What was it that you thought?
She saw no one?
Open the door.
What do you think when you hear music?
One was on a white horse.
Watch over him.
Let me in.
There to the left.
Let me be and let me live.
They are hard at it.
We got under way at last.
Is it in the city?
Are we late?
You are right, father.
Now or never.
We dont see it like that.
But why dont you want to take it?
Have you got it?
How would they stop it?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Say good night.
Look at his face.
When did you begin?
Where have you been this long while?
For once you are right.
It is music.
Go to your father.
Let him grow up with you.
At four, she said.
By and by he got it.
So they got out and went in.
But what did you hear?
She came over last night.
There, do you hear?
Where has she run off to?
To the left.
But they may still come here.
We found it.
Let me know at once when you will start.
You found him?
And then they began to fish.
It was then time to start.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Are you my friend?
It was white.
Write an answer.
Come eat with me.
Let me out.
But take care.
But hard to tell.
How many are left?
Let him follow me.
What do you hear?
They may tell us to open it.
Dont say that to me.
Dont tell me.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Here he is at last.
And he left the room.
Let me hear your story.
At last we have a man.
She must have a hard time with him.
The other night she left.
Do you have a car?
You might want it.
It is so very kind of you both.
Call the next one.
He then said, It is time to start.
Just set still and take it like a man.
You must walk.
Where is the river?
Life is all right.
Let me see her.
But it was very late.
And what did you learn from him?
Who found them out?
Dont move, he said.
Why, is it late?
Point it at his horse.
How did it begin?
Good night again.
What do you think of the music?
No one would have thought the end was so near.
You will answer for it.
It would seem so.
No, dont.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
What would you have me do with my life?
We got one and they got one.
You have a car?
Both of us.
She might be at his house.
He is at sea.
And why should they?
Why, it was one of his own men.
Who should it be?
One never has too much.
Is he a real father?
But then you would be close to the sea?
Do you know what he did last night?
It was like new life to him.
They never come back.
Where could you keep it?
No, never.
Dont you like it?
Who can answer for that?
He is always at it.
Let me see it.
Why should they?
He is my friend.
Give me the letter.
We got to let that go.
They dont know their own country.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Who said four?
And then we may begin.
Let me get to work.
Why is he cross with me?
It might help.
The sun had set long since.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Stop, let me show you the way.
Can you hear me?
He came at once.
Watch him, he said.
Dont you think so?
There are only four of us.
Let me go back.
He saw his men draw back.
We should ask him.
Do you want some more to eat?
She never came back.
So it always was.
But watch over him.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Is it far?
But now it is too late.
So, once more, good night.
See him grow up.
Let me look.
The children will live just the same.
Do you want to cross?
But it is all all too late now.
And now let us go home.
Here is the book.
It is open?
You must never tell.
Tell us a story.
He has been been found.
This is my country.
Let us start, then.
No, said the Tree.
Tell me more.
What was the name of the man who took it?
But you must never tell.
So he began to help.
Is that far?
Then, good night.
Why dont you want to go?
What should he say?
It was his own room.
Off with his head.
Well, read the letter again.
Keep watch all night.
No, said her father.
He has children of his own.
Come over in the sun.
Do you know where he is?
Do you often come back?
And she left the room.
Have you never been there?
And your children?
Ask one of those men.
Few had found it.
You are sure of it?
He said at last.
Stop and think.
Can you stand?
What did you hear?
Let me say one thing.
Off with her head.
Let her go.
There was no letter for me.
There was no answer.
Why dont you play?
They always know.
No, stop.
Here is the paper.
In the country?
They are always the same.
He could run no more.
It is well thought of.
At this time of my life, no.
And who is this friend?
A second man got up and went out.
She saw it.
She is my friend.
Stop, said he.
Right here it began.
Keep to the left.
What country does he come from?
Will you never learn?
You must study.
You must eat now.
