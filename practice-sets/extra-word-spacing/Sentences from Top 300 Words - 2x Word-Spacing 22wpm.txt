He then said, It is time to start.
And now, good night.
Come, let us be men.
We got to let that go.
You will answer for it.
What was it that you thought?
We found it.
That was the first night.
Why dont you want to go?
We must begin again.
My father is right.
They are always the same.
How would they stop it?
Go to your father.
Let me see her.
You have a car?
Let us go in.
Off with his head.
Let me say one thing.
Where has she run off to?
Have you got that?
Do you know how he made his mark?
No, that can never be.
And who is this friend?
It was white.
Let me get on with my work.
So he began to help.
We got under way at last.
Here is the paper.
No, said the Tree.
It was his own room.
If you know, why dont you tell?
She never came back.
We might learn a thing or two.
Let me look.
The other night she left.
Let us go back.
Tell me more.
Is it far?
She saw no one?
What was left of him?
We must go at once.
Why, is it late?
Let me know at once when you will start.
It was the last day of the year.
Let him follow me.
Well, read the letter again.
He is always at it.
He came at once.
Did you see his eye?
He is my friend.
Will you never learn?
Is he a real father?
Point it at his horse.
They may tell us to open it.
One was on a white horse.
There is only food for one.
This is my country.
Say good night.
You must study.
But then it will be too late.
Few had found it.
Are you my friend?
Dont tell me.
It is so very kind of you both.
No, stop.
At last we have a man.
We never thought of that.
Do you often come back?
Dont you see that?
We got one and they got one.
Are you sure?
What a start that was.
Tell her to begin.
Can you hear me?
So, once more, good night.
They never did it again.
It was very hard.
Life is all right.
And what did you learn from him?
Have you been at sea?
Have you never been there?
Do you hear that?
A second man got up and went out.
But take care.
Come eat with me.
Off with her head.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
At four, she said.
Is there any answer?
Do you hear me?
But are you sure of that?
Come here, my friend.
Any book will tell you that.
There were few near me.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Does he never go out?
Take care of him.
She saw it.
Cut him down.
You saw him?
Do you know what he did last night?
Are we late?
Can you stand?
You must eat now.
It will be too late.
She came over last night.
Come at once.
Who let you in?
Are you sure of it?
Let us start, then.
Let me see him.
What do you think when you hear music?
Let us cross over.
Come over in the sun.
You got me?
It is always so.
Here is the letter.
Are we too late?
And then they began to fish.
A call for help, you thought?
We are together.
These were the first people we saw.
Let her go.
Good for the country.
Write an answer.
There was no letter for me.
It would seem so.
But watch over him.
We are very far from that.
What did you hear?
But then you would be close to the sea?
She got up.
No, never.
And your children?
She is my friend.
He is at sea.
Always the same, year after year.
See him grow up.
Is it in the city?
That night we were just in time.
No, dont.
What is life to you?
Was you in my room?
What was the name of the man who took it?
No, said her father.
The children will live just the same.
How many children?
You found him?
And why should they?
Do you want to cross?
What should he say?
It might help.
She might be at his house.
Let him grow up with you.
What would you have me do with my life?
There was no answer.
Still, you never know.
Let me have a word with you.
Stop, said he.
Here we see the boy at school.
Well, what next?
What is your real name?
Who took him out of it?
Give me the letter.
Stop and think.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
And this food?
The sun had set long since.
What do you hear?
He is my father.
Who did you learn that from?
Call the next one.
In the country?
Dont you think so?
How could you let him go so far?
Just set still and take it like a man.
They are hard at it.
Open the door.
There to the left.
You must walk.
But she saw no one?
They always know.
Both of us.
Tell us a story.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
That is the idea.
It is music.
Let me see it.
We should ask him.
You might want it.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Now let me have it.
It is from your father.
Only, dont look back.
It is a long story.
Look at his face.
Let them have it.
Let me hear your story.
Where is the river?
Let me be and let me live.
Then let me have a word with you.
Always the same with you people.
What did he answer?
Come let us see them.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Who said four?
Good night again.
It is open?
Where have you been this long while?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
We should look at this.
By and by he got it.
She is still here?
And what did you do with that letter?
How did it begin?
Let him answer us.
He has children of his own.
And she left the room.
what river is it?
Which end is his head?
They came over last night.
Who should it be?
For once you are right.
But now it is too late.
There, do you hear?
Music is a good thing.
We may be too late.
He may come close.
Think of my father.
Watch him, he said.
First turn to the left.
To the left.
She must have a hard time with him.
Never see him again.
Why should they?
We were together.
You must never tell.
But let us walk.
Stop, let me show you the way.
But why dont you want to take it?
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Let me hear what it is.
You took it.
Do you know where he is?
So take care of me.
Do we stop here?
So it always was.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Let me go back.
Cut your hand open?
What a night it has been.
Take care.
Keep to the left.
He had only one night more to live.
And there are four of you?
They dont care.
How much have you got?
Who was the letter from?
But it is the same with any life.
Keep watch all night.
No, why should he?
Why is he cross with me?
When did you begin?
You should take me there one day.
But hard to tell.
Ask one of those men.
Is that far?
It was like new life to him.
But what did you hear?
It was then time to start.
Let me go to the door.
He has been been found.
Here he is at last.
Do you have the letter?
Dont you want any?
He might still be up.
One never has too much.
He said at last.
One of us will be here all night.
Why should this be so?
Well, let us be sure of that.
At this time of my life, no.
So they got out and went in.
Have you got it?
You are sure of it?
Who found them out?
How many are left?
What did he say in the letter?
But it would be in the paper.
It was the first thing he thought of.
But you got to play music for them.
This took him some time.
Just cut it out, will you?
Who can answer for that?
Sure of what?
Why, it was one of his own men.
Dont you like it?
This is what began it all.
Where could you keep it?
Now you must eat.
Why do you stop here?
She came in just now by the back door.
And he left the room.
But you must never tell.
it took all that time to come over the water.
It must be in her own house.
Dont say that to me.
Keep to the right.
Here is the book.
Where is this city?
Why dont you play?
He saw his men draw back.
Our own people must come first.
How could you begin?
Is my father here?
Have you found it?
This is real.
You are right, father.
He had two left feet.
Just cut it out.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Right here it began.
But it is all all too late now.
We dont see it like that.
But they may still come here.
Who could have thought it?
It is well thought of.
Let me out.
Then, good night.
Which story was it?
Now or never.
They dont know their own country.
What do you think of the music?
Just a few.
And now let us go home.
Let me see him at once.
Watch over him.
Do you have a car?
Let me get to work.
But it was very late.
Do you want some more to eat?
You are sure of that?
Dont move, he said.
Well, run back to her.
They never come back.
And then we may begin.
Let me in.
Good night, friend.
What country does he come from?
There are only four of us.
Why, dont you hear it?
He could run no more.
