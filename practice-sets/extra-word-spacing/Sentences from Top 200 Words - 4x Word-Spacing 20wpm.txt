But what about me?
How long have you been here?
Good, he said.
Time to get out.
There will just be time.
One, two, three.
Do it for me.
And they went home.
She was right.
At your house?
Show me the way he went.
How could she say such a thing.
Give me a light.
Where are they off to now?
It is great.
Good day to you.
Give me your hand.
What do you mean by that?
Here is my hand.
What do you want me to do?
Then what kind is it?
Read that, she said.
Ask her, he said.
Get out of the way.
Where have you been?
Were you here before me?
You are all very kind to me.
You are most kind.
How can you think of such a thing?
There was work to do.
And what are they made of?
But why do you ask me?
Here she is.
He was so kind.
That is just my point.
How old are you?
Where did he come from?
Give it to me, then.
What you have just said is good, very good.
Follow me, said the man.
But you must.
See, they are here.
Is that all you want?
Do you think so?
What does she want?
Where are you?
And do you know why?
And where is it?
It is all the same.
Well then, what do you want?
It was now his turn to look about him.
How can you tell?
For some man.
There, that does me good.
It will take a little time.
Show it to me.
Tell me who made the world.
Say what you want.
But who was your mother?
And why is that?
Where are you from?
Well, and is that all?
Would you now like to look round my place?
How on earth do you know?
We will say no more about it, then.
What on earth does this mean?
Have you been here long?
It was high time.
And what about your mother?
What could she mean by it?
this one, too?
Why is he here?
Tell me all about it.
Where do they get that?
He said that that would help.
He was at work again.
Now where did they come from?
For how much?
He was there too.
What is in your hand?
Why, what is it, then?
But where is he?
Only two there now.
They are here.
You know, you see right through people.
Take some, she said.
There is no place like home.
Where is she?
When will he come back?
It is very kind of you.
Tell us your name.
Put it on.
And it did me good.
Do you think she was?
There is the little boy.
Ask him to show up?
It is very high.
Is she well?
Did you tell him?
How old was she?
That is all one can say about her.
take them all.
She had to tell him.
What do they say was the cause?
Where did you place it?
That was a house to look at.
There was no one near.
Is it as good now?
There is no one here to see.
It is the same thing.
Well, all right.
In what part of the house?
Which house is it?
Will you take me to her?
Is he a good man?
Here it is.
Are they like each other?
Where does he live?
Is it any good?
All right, then.
Go and try.
Move on, then.
Can you help me find my way?
Why, what do you mean?
Tell me about it.
Large or small?
What do you want to ask these people?
Well then, tell him so.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
But where are we to go?
What does all this mean?
And what was his name?
Where are we to turn for help?
Hand it in.
Here it is, he said.
Will you come with me?
What will you say?
Very well, he said.
Then will come our time.
Try it on.
Come with me to the little house.
We are who we say we are.
When will her mother come?
And where was the place?
But what does it mean?
That was a good time.
Where to, now?
He will live.
How did you get here?
Read that, he said.
They want more.
Well, go on.
What do they want?
Now it was time to act.
Give me my work.
Now tell me.
That is the end of her.
Then why are you here?
It must be where you put it.
Very well, show him to me.
Do you want me to do it?
Say no more.
How can you say that?
What is your name?
You think so, too?
She was the cause of it all.
Where is he?
Come with me.
How does he use it?
Call me what you will, he said.
Tell me his name.
And what is her name?
Come with me, then.
Well, and what do you think?
And where is she, then?
Show me the way.
What did he say?
I would like to see her again in that.
Where could he be?
But this is the point.
Well, read it.
Who will tell her?
Do you know me?
Well, what do you think?
Give it me.
After three, he said.
And that was the end of it.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
What is that in your hand?
Is it you or me?
What do you think of her?
What would you have me do?
When will it take place?
That would be very good.
where did she come from?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Think no more about that.
Well, did he?
Give him air.
Why do you want water?
Is there no one who can help me?
What does one live for?
Come and help me.
And who is the man?
You think so?
What was it you said to me?
And what do you think?
Now, go home.
And in she went.
Will you try?
You can say what it is.
You are a good boy.
What did you say your name was?
And have you been here long?
You are right.
Three, he said.
Do you think so now?
Too much of this.
Why do you want to know?
Well, what do you think about it?
All in good time.
Why are you here?
Why are they here?
Now we see the light.
How can you find out?
Where is he now?
That is right, said the old man.
No, mother.
Too much in the way.
Give me more than that
You will get on in the world.
What do you mean?
Who are these men?
Such as what?
We are here.
Is it all right?
Then they will follow you?
But why do you ask?
Where are you off to?
Is it large?
What do you think of this?
Just like me.
And what will they do with us?
You were near him.
Are you at it again?
They had all been very good to us.
You can help me here.
There is more to tell.
Look at it other way round.
And a very good thing, too.
This is the man.
But what did you want?
What do you want?
What on earth do you mean?
there are only two.
What does he mean?
No, tell me.
In what year?
Well, here he is.
Is he big?
Where are we?
You must take me with you.
Show us where you live, said the man.
She has a house?
How did you get me out?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
He is at my house.
Look at me.
But it is just so with the world.
What did you say that for?
What a good thing it would be.
What was his name?
Think it over.
Why is that?
Who is that man?
He will ask for it.
You see it every day.
What do you think of him?
How do you take it?
She has been with him many long years.
What do you think of that?
Are you back again?
Here is the way we put in the time.
And how old were you at that time?
You must tell me.
Some day you may ask me about it.
But he does so need a mother.
Is that right?
How much do you want?
What did he tell you?
Say no more about it.
Are you here for good?
What do you play?
She came up to them.
Get out and play.
How did that help you?
And off we go.
Too much for me now.
Can you point it out to me?
How does she use you?
What does she think about me?
And what did she say?
Tell us all about it.
Where have they been?
Now, you know me.
He said too much.
do you come from the end of the world?
What does it all mean?
Just look at her.
What more could a man ask for?
Been back long?
Now, what do you want with me?
Just look through it.
Much good that would be.
And what did he say?
Well, tell me.
And where is this man?
But where is it?
What could set you off in the first place?
See, here it is.
Why are you like this?
He has more to give.
Well, how did it go?
Where do you live?
If you want to know, go and find out.
Think of him.
And how did you find out?
He went on his way.
You must come now.
It would be very kind of you.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
How much are they?
Play with them.
This is the first act.
She went on.
The world is before you.
This for me?
Get to work.
The first act was over.
Take this and this.
What will each of you give?
Turn this way.
That is right.
To what end?
But he is right.
And how in the world did you find them?
Why did he come?
Very well then.
Think what you will.
There she is again.
Where in the world did you come from?
And where is he now?
We must come back.
Can you take me?
What have you been after?
He was here.
He went to him.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Now come here.
Good day, one and all.
What is his name?
This is my point.
Well, how are you?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
That was very good.
Is there some for me?
Is this the man?
