Does he never go out?
It must be in her own house.
How would they stop it?
To the left.
Let me in.
There to the left.
It might help.
Why should this be so?
Let him follow me.
They may tell us to open it.
Point it at his horse.
You are right, father.
Can you hear me?
And what did you learn from him?
Let us go back.
He is always at it.
They are hard at it.
In the country?
First turn to the left.
Tell us a story.
Here we see the boy at school.
They never come back.
That is the idea.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
What did he say in the letter?
Who can answer for that?
He may come close.
No, stop.
Always the same, year after year.
Tell her to begin.
She must have a hard time with him.
The other night she left.
Music is a good thing.
Cut your hand open?
What did he answer?
At this time of my life, no.
But they may still come here.
Then let me have a word with you.
It was the last day of the year.
But it was very late.
This is what began it all.
He is my friend.
Off with her head.
At four, she said.
Is it far?
But it is the same with any life.
Just cut it out.
He has children of his own.
Think of my father.
Well, read the letter again.
You must eat now.
Do you want to cross?
Why, it was one of his own men.
Off with his head.
Let me see him.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Let me go back.
Say good night.
It was then time to start.
Let me see him at once.
Who said four?
Good night again.
My father is right.
That was the first night.
Let us cross over.
They dont care.
Who let you in?
You found him?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
But hard to tell.
It was like new life to him.
Let me hear what it is.
But take care.
Can you stand?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
One never has too much.
What was left of him?
We might learn a thing or two.
Call the next one.
Do you know what he did last night?
So he began to help.
But it would be in the paper.
Here is the book.
What is life to you?
Was you in my room?
Any book will tell you that.
But are you sure of that?
And he left the room.
But then it will be too late.
Let him answer us.
Let me go to the door.
Let me have a word with you.
They are always the same.
Now you must eat.
He came at once.
Never see him again.
Why is he cross with me?
Ask one of those men.
He had two left feet.
Which end is his head?
She never came back.
We were together.
Why dont you play?
Look at his face.
Come let us see them.
And then they began to fish.
You have a car?
A call for help, you thought?
You must study.
What was it that you thought?
You are sure of it?
See him grow up.
Who should it be?
No, why should he?
And your children?
Let me see it.
But she saw no one?
The sun had set long since.
Let me say one thing.
So they got out and went in.
Do you have the letter?
The children will live just the same.
What country does he come from?
That night we were just in time.
It was his own room.
There, do you hear?
Good for the country.
He has been been found.
By and by he got it.
Have you got it?
Open the door.
Have you never been there?
Are you sure of it?
What do you think of the music?
We must go at once.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Dont say that to me.
Why, dont you hear it?
It is always so.
This took him some time.
Let me look.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Keep to the right.
Why dont you want to go?
Do you know where he is?
There were few near me.
We found it.
Our own people must come first.
They came over last night.
We got under way at last.
Just a few.
But let us walk.
You got me?
Who found them out?
Stop, let me show you the way.
We should look at this.
She saw it.
Watch over him.
It is music.
He then said, It is time to start.
These were the first people we saw.
How many children?
Who could have thought it?
At last we have a man.
What a start that was.
Did you see his eye?
Is that far?
Are you sure?
You saw him?
You will answer for it.
They always know.
You should take me there one day.
No, never.
Why should they?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
How could you begin?
A second man got up and went out.
Give me the letter.
Let me be and let me live.
Who took him out of it?
We should ask him.
There is only food for one.
We may be too late.
Have you got that?
It would seem so.
You must walk.
Cut him down.
Let us start, then.
We got to let that go.
Let me see her.
Let me out.
Where have you been this long while?
And there are four of you?
And now let us go home.
One night more and he would be on his way.
What should he say?
She is still here?
No, said the Tree.
You took it.
Have you been at sea?
He is at sea.
He saw his men draw back.
You are sure of that?
But then you would be close to the sea?
Why do you stop here?
what river is it?
What would you have me do with my life?
Let her go.
Will you never learn?
It was very hard.
And this food?
How did it begin?
And now, good night.
When did you begin?
And then we may begin.
Just cut it out, will you?
So it always was.
What did you hear?
Do we stop here?
It is well thought of.
Let me get to work.
Well, run back to her.
Why, is it late?
How could you let him go so far?
She might be at his house.
So, once more, good night.
Come at once.
Now or never.
He is my father.
Have you found it?
If you know, why dont you tell?
But why dont you want to take it?
Is there any answer?
You must never tell.
Do you hear that?
There was no answer.
What do you think when you hear music?
Are we late?
It will be too late.
But now it is too late.
Come eat with me.
But you must never tell.
Where has she run off to?
She came over last night.
There are only four of us.
But it is all all too late now.
it took all that time to come over the water.
They never did it again.
For once you are right.
Write an answer.
Let me hear your story.
Do you have a car?
Do you often come back?
Is it in the city?
But what did you hear?
But watch over him.
She is my friend.
Take care of him.
Let me know at once when you will start.
He said at last.
You might want it.
And why should they?
Only, dont look back.
Dont tell me.
One of us will be here all night.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Let us go in.
Good night, friend.
Keep watch all night.
Now let me have it.
Go to your father.
Watch him, he said.
Is he a real father?
Do you want some more to eat?
Tell me more.
No, that can never be.
But you got to play music for them.
Dont you like it?
Are we too late?
Do you hear me?
It is a long story.
We never thought of that.
Right here it began.
What is your real name?
Come here, my friend.
One was on a white horse.
Keep to the left.
Which story was it?
It is open?
No, said her father.
Both of us.
It is from your father.
Dont move, he said.
And who is this friend?
We got one and they got one.
Sure of what?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Here is the paper.
This is my country.
This is real.
He might still be up.
Here he is at last.
Dont you think so?
And she left the room.
She saw no one?
Is my father here?
How many are left?
Then, good night.
She got up.
Well, what next?
No, dont.
Where is the river?
What a night it has been.
They dont know their own country.
Life is all right.
Come, let us be men.
How much have you got?
Stop, said he.
Here is the letter.
We are together.
Come over in the sun.
Where could you keep it?
We must begin again.
Let them have it.
We are very far from that.
Few had found it.
It is so very kind of you both.
Stop and think.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Where is this city?
He had only one night more to live.
Let me get on with my work.
There was no letter for me.
Who was the letter from?
Do you know how he made his mark?
He could run no more.
Let him grow up with you.
Dont you see that?
This took place at his house, in his room.
Always the same with you people.
So take care of me.
And what did you do with that letter?
She came in just now by the back door.
What was the name of the man who took it?
Who did you learn that from?
What do you hear?
We dont see it like that.
It was white.
Take care.
Are you my friend?
Dont you want any?
Still, you never know.
