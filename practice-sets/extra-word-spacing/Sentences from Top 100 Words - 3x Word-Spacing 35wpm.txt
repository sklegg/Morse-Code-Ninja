Look at it.
Is she like him?
How is he?
He said no.
There they are.
Is he there?
That is a long time.
Can it be?
There he is, do you see him?
You have it.
When was that?
Go on, he said.
But what is it?
Then who are you?
And who was that?
What do you make of that?
What can this be?
It was from you.
What time is it?
But he had no time.
What would she have said?
But so it is.
That was it.
What is all this?
What DO you know of him?
Do you know her?
Do you know him?
And do you like her?
There you are, he said.
And what did you see?
That will do, said he.
What did he do to you?
And what was it for?
What are we to do?
That is what she did.
What have you come for?
How is she?
What was he like?
But what will you do?
What is it for?
Are you there?
What is it all about?
How did you know about it?
Out of the way.
Do you know what you look like?
Can one see from there?
Now there is no more to be said.
How did you come by it?
what has she to do with it?
What can we do, then?
You know more than we do.
What is there to see?
what is it?
What will you do, then?
Would you do what he did?
How would you like to have it?
You can have some.
who can it be?
How did he do it?
So be it.
Is it time?
And when will you call?
But who was she?
But it was of no use.
One or two?
What did you do then?
And all for what?
And could she see him?
Had to look the other way.
Do you see him?
Look at them.
There he is, you see.
No one will come, she said.
Did you know them?
Now you know.
What is it about?
How did she do it?
But what have they been up to?
and so on, and so on.
What is he like?
How is he now?
Will you come and see her?
Do you like him?
And who is this?
Did you see it?
Can you do that?
Who was he?
And do you like him?
Is that all?
You have them?
Then how many are there?
Is it over?
What do you see?
We have no water.
Then what are you up to now?
Look at it this way.
But he had to have it.
Or so they said.
Did you know her?
What do you make of it?
Which is it?
And what do you call her?
There he is, she said.
At what number?
But what are you up to?
The time will come.
Look at him.
How can you know?
We have him.
How do you do?
But when will that be?
Did you know him?
So it is.
Look over it.
What other way is there to look at it?
What could it be?
Do you know?
Is that her?
are you there?
What is that?
So there it was.
Will that do?
The time had come.
And how did you find out?
but what if it is?
What was it about?
There were two of them.
Then there is more to do.
How was that?
What did they do?
Come this way.
What do they call you?
Then make it up.
What is it like?
But how is that?
There you are.
Do you see it?
but we can go and see.
Do as you will.
And has it come to this?
But will he see it?
Who and what are you?
Who are you?
Who was that?
You may go.
But how about you?
There is but one thing to do.
Do as you like.
You can do it.
but there was more to it than this.
Then what is it?
And what do you make of it?
How long has he been there?
At what time?
When is it?
Is that it?
You can go.
So that was the way.
And is that all?
Has it come to this?
Who will go first?
Do they know him?
And who are you?
Is it like him?
Now what are we to do with you?
That will do, he said.
She has it.
Call him in.
And what did you do then?
who, then, are you?
Would you like some?
So it was.
Who is she?
Now is your time.
Did you see her?
You know how it is with her.
But WHAT DID you see?
Do you know what it is?
Tqhen you may go.
May we come in?
What was it?
That was all she said.
How can it be?
Then, how do you know?
But it has been so long.
No was there one?
How are you?
When was it?
They said no more.
And what is that?
What are you up to?
and so on, and so on.
We have no water.
And what did you see?
What could it be?
are you there?
Is that her?
What do you see?
What is there to see?
And when will you call?
What was it?
What will you do, then?
You can have some.
There were two of them.
And who are you?
That was all she said.
What other way is there to look at it?
When was that?
What are you up to?
Look at them.
When was it?
He said no.
What can we do, then?
But it has been so long.
Can you do that?
Then there is more to do.
Then make it up.
And all for what?
That will do, said he.
What is all this?
And has it come to this?
But what have they been up to?
Then what are you up to now?
Then who are you?
Did you know them?
Is he there?
but there was more to it than this.
who can it be?
How is he?
How would you like to have it?
What is it like?
Look at him.
What do they call you?
But how is that?
How can it be?
How do you do?
Do as you like.
How did he do it?
There you are, he said.
And what do you call her?
How is he now?
But what is it?
And how did you find out?
Do you know what you look like?
But he had to have it.
Do you know him?
The time will come.
And who was that?
And who is this?
Is it like him?
What is he like?
Who was that?
But who was she?
And what was it for?
Now there is no more to be said.
So it was.
Are you there?
What is it about?
Now you know.
And do you like her?
Who will go first?
Go on, he said.
What have you come for?
who, then, are you?
What was he like?
How is she?
what is it?
How long has he been there?
There is but one thing to do.
Now what are we to do with you?
But he had no time.
Do you like him?
There he is, do you see him?
She has it.
One or two?
How did you know about it?
You have them?
And what do you make of it?
How was that?
Then how many are there?
So be it.
but we can go and see.
You may go.
Do as you will.
Do they know him?
What is it all about?
You know how it is with her.
May we come in?
So there it was.
What are we to do?
Now is your time.
Look at it this way.
How are you?
The time had come.
Then what is it?
But when will that be?
Do you know?
And do you like him?
Has it come to this?
Did you see it?
Who was he?
Do you know her?
Who is she?
But what will you do?
And what did you do then?
Is it over?
Who and what are you?
That will do, he said.
Which is it?
So it is.
Out of the way.
And is that all?
But so it is.
How did she do it?
Who are you?
It was from you.
That was it.
And what is that?
What can this be?
Tqhen you may go.
Is that all?
What time is it?
When is it?

No one will come, she said.
Will that do?
But it was of no use.
