That is the idea.
See him grow up.
The sun had set long since.
Have you been at sea?
Who can answer for that?
Look at his face.
No, dont.
Is my father here?
This is my country.
Do you have a car?
What was the name of the man who took it?
This took him some time.
Just cut it out.
Any book will tell you that.
You took it.
She might be at his house.
Why, is it late?
How much have you got?
One was on a white horse.
Let me get on with my work.
There was no answer.
Dont tell me.
You are sure of that?
At this time of my life, no.
He had two left feet.
At four, she said.
She is my friend.
For once you are right.
They never come back.
Here is the book.
She saw it.
Come eat with me.
Come here, my friend.
How would they stop it?
Keep to the right.
Our own people must come first.
There, do you hear?
You must walk.
We might learn a thing or two.
We should look at this.
But they may still come here.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Sure of what?
Do you know what he did last night?
Who did you learn that from?
Are you my friend?
Dont you want any?
Who should it be?
Dont you see that?
Watch over him.
Just cut it out, will you?
You should take me there one day.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Why dont you want to go?
Cut your hand open?
And she left the room.
She must have a hard time with him.
How could you begin?
Only, dont look back.
Open the door.
But you got to play music for them.
In the country?
Do we stop here?
First turn to the left.
Let me say one thing.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Cut him down.
And then we may begin.
He is at sea.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
it took all that time to come over the water.
What a night it has been.
Why, dont you hear it?
But now it is too late.
He has children of his own.
One night more and he would be on his way.
You must study.
We must go at once.
Do you hear that?
It would seem so.
This is what began it all.
Have you never been there?
Let me get to work.
You will answer for it.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Still, you never know.
Come, let us be men.
This is real.
Tell us a story.
We got to let that go.
Good night again.
But hard to tell.
Let him answer us.
It was his own room.
Say good night.
She is still here?
Let me see it.
Do you know how he made his mark?
And then they began to fish.
Keep watch all night.
We were together.
Why should this be so?
And now let us go home.
We are very far from that.
You are sure of it?
Let us go in.
He is always at it.
Have you got it?
And this food?
He had no idea how long he had been there.
But she saw no one?
What did you hear?
What did he say in the letter?
And what did you do with that letter?
You saw him?
It was very hard.
She never came back.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Who took him out of it?
He could run no more.
Write an answer.
What a start that was.
We should ask him.
Life is all right.
It is so very kind of you both.
Here he is at last.
Where is this city?
Why do you stop here?
There was no letter for me.
It is well thought of.
It is always so.
He saw his men draw back.
So they got out and went in.
There are only four of us.
Is he a real father?
Point it at his horse.
Where have you been this long while?
We got under way at last.
Let me go to the door.
But watch over him.
Why should they?
What do you think of the music?
Now or never.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Here is the paper.
But then you would be close to the sea?
Let me hear what it is.
He is my friend.
Well, run back to her.
And why should they?
That night we were just in time.
To the left.
Off with his head.
Stop and think.
But why dont you want to take it?
And he left the room.
He then said, It is time to start.
Who could have thought it?
Let me be and let me live.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
You have a car?
Does he never go out?
Do you often come back?
It is music.
Where is the river?
Dont you like it?
Are we late?
Let them have it.
He said at last.
No, said the Tree.
Call the next one.
They never did it again.
Come let us see them.
And what did you learn from him?
The children will live just the same.
It is open?
The other night she left.
There is only food for one.
Is there any answer?
Was you in my room?
No, that can never be.
Stop, said he.
He has been been found.
No, why should he?
They are always the same.
Let him grow up with you.
What was it that you thought?
They are hard at it.
One never has too much.
Well, read the letter again.
How many children?
Off with her head.
By and by he got it.
Go to your father.
You are right, father.
Keep to the left.
Are you sure of it?
It was the last day of the year.
What do you hear?
They dont know their own country.
A call for help, you thought?
One of us will be here all night.
She got up.
You might want it.
Where has she run off to?
But then it will be too late.
He may come close.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Who was the letter from?
Which end is his head?
Always the same with you people.
And there are four of you?
We never thought of that.
Who said four?
Dont you think so?
No, never.
We must begin again.
You got me?
It will be too late.
Never see him again.
We got one and they got one.
Come over in the sun.
When did you begin?
Always the same, year after year.
At last we have a man.
Which story was it?
Well, what next?
It must be in her own house.
You must eat now.
No, said her father.
Dont move, he said.
So it always was.
Well, let us be sure of that.
They dont care.
And your children?
Just set still and take it like a man.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Can you stand?
Then let me have a word with you.
Think of my father.
It is a long story.
But it is all all too late now.
Let us go back.
But it is the same with any life.
Is that far?
Ask one of those men.
We may be too late.
Take care.
You found him?
It was then time to start.
But let us walk.
Stop, let me show you the way.
We dont see it like that.
Why, it was one of his own men.
And who is this friend?
But you must never tell.
What is your real name?
My father is right.
It was like new life to him.
How could you let him go so far?
Why is he cross with me?
Dont say that to me.
No, stop.
Good night, friend.
Are we too late?
What would you have me do with my life?
Right here it began.
Let us cross over.
There to the left.
Take care of him.
They always know.
Let us start, then.
So he began to help.
How did it begin?
She came over last night.
Did you see his eye?
Let me see him.
Who found them out?
Can you hear me?
These were the first people we saw.
Have you found it?
It is from your father.
Let him follow me.
Is it far?
They came over last night.
A second man got up and went out.
Why dont you play?
Come at once.
Now let me have it.
We are together.
Give me the letter.
What should he say?
You must never tell.
There were few near me.
Is it in the city?
Good for the country.
Music is a good thing.
Let me look.
Both of us.
Tell her to begin.
It might help.
He had only one night more to live.
Let me in.
It was white.
Few had found it.
But it was very late.
He might still be up.
What country does he come from?
How many are left?
Have you got that?
Do you want some more to eat?
He came at once.
Here we see the boy at school.
Let me go back.
Who let you in?
What was left of him?
Just a few.
Here is the letter.
And now, good night.
What did he answer?
But it would be in the paper.
what river is it?
What do you think when you hear music?
She saw no one?
So, once more, good night.
But take care.
Do you know where he is?
She came in just now by the back door.
Do you hear me?
Let me see her.
But what did you hear?
Will you never learn?
We found it.
Let me out.
Are you sure?
What is life to you?
Let me hear your story.
Watch him, he said.
Let me see him at once.
Tell me more.
So take care of me.
Let her go.
Now you must eat.
Let me know at once when you will start.
They may tell us to open it.
Do you want to cross?
That was the first night.
Do you have the letter?
Where could you keep it?
But are you sure of that?
Then, good night.
Let me have a word with you.
He is my father.
