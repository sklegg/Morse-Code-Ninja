He has children of his own.
Right here it began.
Do you hear me?
She saw no one?
it took all that time to come over the water.
Why should they?
Few had found it.
First turn to the left.
We got to let that go.
Here is the letter.
You found him?
Dont you think so?
We never thought of that.
Tell us a story.
Then let me have a word with you.
Where could you keep it?
Are we too late?
Who said four?
Let me see her.
And there are four of you?
Who was the letter from?
They may tell us to open it.
Who took him out of it?
But take care.
Who found them out?
It was then time to start.
What country does he come from?
You took it.
One of us will be here all night.
Ask one of those men.
She came in just now by the back door.
Life is all right.
What did he say in the letter?
There was no letter for me.
There, do you hear?
It is music.
Let me hear your story.
No, why should he?
Good for the country.
We got one and they got one.
Sure of what?
We found it.
What is your real name?
Let him follow me.
Have you found it?
But they may still come here.
But she saw no one?
Stop, said he.
Are you my friend?
Do you want to cross?
The sun had set long since.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Tell her to begin.
Dont say that to me.
Why, is it late?
It was like new life to him.
Let me have a word with you.
There were few near me.
At last we have a man.
Go to your father.
Dont tell me.
He is always at it.
That night we were just in time.
Call the next one.
And she left the room.
We must go at once.
Come let us see them.
There are only four of us.
Does he never go out?
And who is this friend?
She is still here?
But then it will be too late.
Let them have it.
Well, what next?
He had two left feet.
Stop and think.
But are you sure of that?
Just set still and take it like a man.
Who should it be?
My father is right.
It was white.
Why is he cross with me?
But why dont you want to take it?
Do you have the letter?
Let him grow up with you.
Stop, let me show you the way.
When did you begin?
Who can answer for that?
Who did you learn that from?
It is open?
What was left of him?
No, never.
Always the same, year after year.
But now it is too late.
They never did it again.
Do you know where he is?
What was it that you thought?
It was very hard.
Which story was it?
Let me know at once when you will start.
Do you want some more to eat?
Is he a real father?
She came over last night.
Now let me have it.
Open the door.
It will be too late.
Let me look.
The other night she left.
It is so very kind of you both.
He might still be up.
Let him answer us.
She might be at his house.
But you must never tell.
what river is it?
What do you think when you hear music?
Is my father here?
Here we see the boy at school.
Just cut it out.
Let me get to work.
They are always the same.
Take care.
Did you see his eye?
Where is this city?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
It is well thought of.
Never see him again.
You are sure of it?
He saw his men draw back.
One was on a white horse.
Here is the book.
What should he say?
Here he is at last.
That was the first night.
But it would be in the paper.
There is only food for one.
Do we stop here?
Still, you never know.
We should ask him.
No, said her father.
You got me?
Here is the paper.
You will answer for it.
No, said the Tree.
How much have you got?
You are right, father.
She saw it.
This is my country.
You might want it.
Write an answer.
How did it begin?
Take care of him.
These were the first people we saw.
Music is a good thing.
But let us walk.
Look at his face.
You should take me there one day.
We got under way at last.
But you got to play music for them.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Our own people must come first.
Let me go back.
She never came back.
Let us cross over.
One never has too much.
And then we may begin.
Keep to the right.
This is what began it all.
Do you hear that?
Can you stand?
What would you have me do with my life?
We must begin again.
You are sure of that?
At this time of my life, no.
Keep watch all night.
So he began to help.
Tell me more.
So they got out and went in.
In the country?
We are together.
Is it in the city?
No one would have thought the end was so near.
The children will live just the same.
It was his own room.
They dont care.
Is that far?
Off with his head.
They dont know their own country.
How many children?
There to the left.
Dont move, he said.
It might help.
Just a few.
Why, it was one of his own men.
Are you sure of it?
Think of my father.
You must walk.
Let me out.
How would they stop it?
We might learn a thing or two.
To the left.
It must be in her own house.
This took him some time.
But what did you hear?
She got up.
Keep to the left.
How could you let him go so far?
Let me see him.
By and by he got it.
You must eat now.
Is it far?
And what did you learn from him?
Why, dont you hear it?
You saw him?
But it was very late.
What a start that was.
Off with her head.
Will you never learn?
And now, good night.
Do you know what he did last night?
But hard to tell.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Come here, my friend.
This is real.
Dont you like it?
Just cut it out, will you?
They are hard at it.
We dont see it like that.
Do you often come back?
They never come back.
If you know, why dont you tell?
He came at once.
He then said, It is time to start.
And your children?
So it always was.
And now let us go home.
He is my friend.
Come over in the sun.
So, once more, good night.
We are very far from that.
Both of us.
He is at sea.
Is there any answer?
He is my father.
A second man got up and went out.
And he left the room.
Why should this be so?
What was the name of the man who took it?
Are you sure?
Where have you been this long while?
What do you think of the music?
This took place at his house, in his room.
Let me get on with my work.
He has been been found.
That is the idea.
Have you got that?
Cut him down.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Point it at his horse.
He could run no more.
Can you hear me?
Always the same with you people.
They came over last night.
But it is all all too late now.
And why should they?
She must have a hard time with him.
What do you hear?
Why dont you play?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
But watch over him.
Where is the river?
Are we late?
And what did you do with that letter?
Watch over him.
Which end is his head?
We may be too late.
Have you never been there?
Who let you in?
And then they began to fish.
Have you been at sea?
He said at last.
It is always so.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
What a night it has been.
Was you in my room?
For once you are right.
Let me see him at once.
No, that can never be.
Good night again.
Do you know how he made his mark?
You must study.
Why dont you want to go?
She is my friend.
You have a car?
Where has she run off to?
And this food?
Who could have thought it?
Let me go to the door.
What did he answer?
Let her go.
Come eat with me.
Now or never.
He had only one night more to live.
What did you hear?
Have you got it?
Dont you want any?
Well, run back to her.
No, dont.
One night more and he would be on his way.
How many are left?
Let me in.
Let us go in.
A call for help, you thought?
So take care of me.
Let us start, then.
Well, read the letter again.
You must never tell.
But it is the same with any life.
Cut your hand open?
Good night, friend.
He may come close.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
It is a long story.
We were together.
What is life to you?
We should look at this.
Come at once.
They always know.
Say good night.
Only, dont look back.
How could you begin?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Then, good night.
Watch him, he said.
There was no answer.
See him grow up.
It is from your father.
It was the last day of the year.
Dont you see that?
It would seem so.
Give me the letter.
But then you would be close to the sea?
Let me say one thing.
Now you must eat.
At four, she said.
No, stop.
Come, let us be men.
Let me be and let me live.
Let me see it.
Any book will tell you that.
Let me hear what it is.
Let us go back.
Why do you stop here?
Do you have a car?
