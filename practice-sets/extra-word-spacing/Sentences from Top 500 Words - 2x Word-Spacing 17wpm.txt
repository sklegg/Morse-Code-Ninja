Yes, it is true.
Decide if you are going back home.
It was right in front of us.
Oh let me in.
The whole day had been hot.
You can sleep here.
Nothing new under the sun.
Yes, you are right.
It was a cold, dark night.
Bring this with you.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Yes, to be sure.
But what must be done?
And he told you nothing?
What did the letter contain?
You are free to do so.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
What is power?
Let him go free?
Who gave it to you?
You could see there was a story behind it.
You can hear that, miss?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
How can a little dog laugh?
Yes, but only for you and me.
Wonder is it like that.
The island was a mile long.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Oh, no.
Why did you bring him here?
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
He never said nothing.
He had made up his mind.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Oh, just listen.
But let us see your plan.
Never mind me.
Go in there and drive them out.
Free to do what?
The night was very dark.
Your voice is that of a young man.
It has to be done.
What has brought you here?
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Now we must wait.
She was still game.
Go back to bed.
We are more strong together.
Behind my bed.
But she is nothing to me now.
Just go to sleep.
Dont laugh.
Of course it might.
Her voice was low.
Well then, be quick.
He has a good voice still.
It is his voice.
It is no use, said a voice.
There is no possible way.
Yes, my love?
All that for nothing?
Oh, very well, he said.
It was brought to me.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
It was a warm night.
Yes, of course.
He is in the box.
All of this was possible.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Oh, take me with you.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Nothing could have been better.
Never mind how he came here.
He is among us.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
I hear his voice in the house.
Quick, friend, quick.
Why should my father fly?
And you can do nothing until then?
Yes, and no.
Bring it here.
This made him wonder more and more.
Yes, go and find out.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Of course they will.
All right then, sit down.
Yes, she could sing that.
He must wait.
Wait and see.
Stay where you are.
Do you see that island?
What have they done with my work?
Yes, he did.
Is that possible?
Is my father in town?
He gave me this paper.
Nothing she can eat?
It was so very long ago.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Yes and no.
That is possible.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Well, of course.
And then the game began all over again.
Behind every book is a man.
His first cry was for his father.
It must be done.
It was a very dark night.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Of course she will.
Laugh, if you will.
That was well done.
There, by the wheel.
Nothing had come of it.
Oh, do as you like.
It was full of people.
Here is our plan.
What is done is done.
Sit down, said the old man.
Keep clear of him.
It is possible.
Again came the voice.
Oh, that is very simple.
It stood behind the door.
He left long ago.
The snow is deep.
Wonder what he does.
Look at that dark water.
Yes, we know that.
It was a kind of language between us.
You will fall.
Money is no object?
His plan is very simple.
She heard and saw nothing.
But wait a minute.
People might know my voice and find me out.
That would be a fine thing.
See what you have done.
There was more to be done.
This is a test.
You love a certain person.
Well yes, you are right.
Yes, sit down.
It is time for bed.
Oh, go on.
He knew nothing.
Did he fall?
Yes, very well.
Oh, but you were there?
But how long ago?
You are in my power.
What has he done?
But that is nothing to us.
Yes, go on.
Where can you wait for me?
Oh, come now.
Yes, all right.
It was very dark.
In her name, then, let it be done.
They would cry.
Yes, that was a picture book.
What brought you here?
You must stay.
Which box do you mean?
It was done.
And what have you done to me?
Is he in bed?
And here is the note.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Better sit still.
It is certain.
Well, sit down.
And what a voice she has.
Then all was dark again.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Well, what about my plan?
What have they done?
Good to rest once in a way.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Oh, of course.
Wonder if he has a name.
What a game.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Nothing is more simple.
Is it possible?
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
You know nothing about it.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Oh, take those off.
Get to bed.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Never mind that.
Come, let me show you my plan.
She got her hand free.
They all fall to the ground.
Take good note of it.
Wait a second.
Answer me that, miss.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Yes, but what did she say?
She gave me her hand.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
This voice was that of my father.
They call him a fine boy.
No, nothing at all.
It is a real bed.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Yes, it did.
It must be done at once.
Try to sleep.
Oh, he is so kind.
Of course he was right.
But they could see nothing.
Nothing at all.
Leave the rest to me.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Half the town was there.
Did she stay long?
All was dark.
Will you rest here a little?
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
It was a record run.
What more is to be done?
He stood up.
Let her wait.
Do you have my note?
You must stay with me.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
He brought it with him for us to see.
Yes, said the old man.
There is no one in that room behind you.
It was hot.
It was cold and dark.
Be back in a minute.
Oh, if men only knew.
They need a rest.
Yes, she said.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Oh, dont ask me.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
You knew it, and said nothing?
It might have done me good.
They know nothing about it.
No, nothing of the kind.
Can it be possible?
And yet you said he had money.
Come, and we can rest together.
She began to cry.
Yes, once.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Are you strong?
In that town there is a street.
Yes, there it is.
Oh, this is too much.
Play the game out.
My mind is made up.
Oh, that.
He ran up to them.
We brought them in.
What age is he?
You brought no one with you?
Nothing could be more simple.
Well, sit down by me.
There is your old bed.
He saw nothing.
He must be in the same boat as us.
Very well, wait a minute.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Is that a fact?
Just let us go free.
Is it certain?
Oh, man.
It is all done.
Money is power.
In a minute.
Why, of course.
We are free to act and think.
Oh, all right.
He will sleep an hour.
Clear my name.
Who brought you up?
And yet you are the better off?
Oh, how can you sleep?
Yes, that is true.
Lead me to him.
Oh, nothing.
It is very clear.
A fine thing too.
But what then must be done?
It was so long ago.
Clear the table.
But never mind that.
You know you must say yes.
is it come yet?
Wait for me.
What can be done?
It is done.
We must be quick.
The water ran dry.
Fly, my friend.
Come quick.
Bring them here.
The city was soon behind me.
Yes, she was back.
Yes, what is it?
Oh, to be sure.
Sit down, he said.
Oh, tell me.
and so he decide he go back home.
Yes, he said.
The night was dark.
Let us sit down.
How long ago?
How is that done?
Like these in shape and size?
How long would you keep me in town?
What kind of voice is it?
It is nothing.
He began to laugh.
Well, but where can he fly to?
If only they would be quick.
Wait a minute.
You must have a rest.
There is nothing more to be said.
What have you done?
Yes, he said, all of it.
Well, there he stood.
Perhaps he did.
Well, miss?
That is a fact.
Clear the way.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Did it all rest on me?
Let me see your plan.
Then lead the way.
There is a lot of people.
How was that possible?
Then he must be a wonder.
Help me sit up.
He was here a minute ago.
Are they on foot?
Oh, do the best you can.
The old man gave no answer.
Did she fall?
My mind was soon made up.
It was a dark night.
How was it done?
His will be done.
Go and rest.
Oh, do you know?
You better stay here all night.
And sit in the dark?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Fine, very fine.
Oh, you are there.
Of course it is.
Do you talk in your sleep?
But it must be done soon.
At his side was a large green box.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Hold on a minute.
Then it is certain?
