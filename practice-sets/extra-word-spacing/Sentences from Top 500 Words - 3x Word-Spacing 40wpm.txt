Fly, my friend.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Yes, go on.
How is that done?
And what have you done to me?
It is no use, said a voice.
She gave me her hand.
Very well, wait a minute.
Clear the table.
Wonder what he does.
Help me sit up.
Oh, go on.
Yes and no.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
The island was a mile long.
What age is he?
The little boy lay in his bed.
Will you rest here a little?
Wait and see.
Laugh, if you will.
At his side was a large green box.
If only they would be quick.
Wait a second.
And what a voice she has.
Stay where you are.
He must wait.
In that town there is a street.
Did he fall?
Here is our plan.
Yes, we know that.
He brought it with him for us to see.
We are more strong together.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
But let us see your plan.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Just let us go free.
But she is nothing to me now.
They know nothing about it.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Is he in bed?
He must be in the same boat as us.
He left long ago.
But what must be done?
Oh, take those off.
There was more to be done.
You know you must say yes.
It is all done.
Yes, you are right.
Where can you wait for me?
Yes, it did.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
What kind of voice is it?
And yet you are the better off?
A fine thing too.
What did the letter contain?
He gave me this paper.
What is power?
There is no possible way.
Oh, tell me.
All of this was possible.
Bring it here.
Now we must wait.
It was cold and dark.
We are free to act and think.
Yes, he did.
Again came the voice.
Nothing could have been better.
Yes, my love?
You can sleep here.
Oh, dont ask me.
But wait a minute.
Is that a fact?
Well then, be quick.
You know nothing about it.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Are you strong?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Nothing she can eat?
He is among us.
Why, of course.
What have you done?
Oh, do you know?
How long would you keep me in town?
He has a good voice still.
There, by the wheel.
It was so long ago.
You love a certain person.
No, nothing at all.
Well, sit down.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Then all was dark again.
What have they done with my work?
It might have done me good.
Wait a minute.
Wait for me.
Bring this with you.
You brought no one with you?
She heard and saw nothing.
That is possible.
is it come yet?
It has to be done.
It must be done at once.
Well, what does that lead up to?
You are free to do so.
Well, sit down by me.
Sit down, said the old man.
He stood up.
What can be done?
Well, but where can he fly to?
Hold on a minute.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
His will be done.
It was hot.
Oh, that.
We brought them in.
Let us sit down.
You must stay with me.
Behind every book is a man.
And you can do nothing until then?
He knew nothing.
Of course they will.
Yes, that is true.
It is his voice.
It was so very long ago.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
It was very dark.
Let me see your plan.
It was brought to me.
Yes, that was a picture book.
No, nothing of the kind.
You are in my power.
He ran up to them.
There is a lot of people.
But what then must be done?
What more is to be done?
Oh let me in.
Which box do you mean?
Yes, she was back.
They call him a fine boy.
My mind is made up.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Come, let me show you my plan.
They all fall to the ground.
Half the town was there.
Of course he was right.
Yes, sit down.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
He is in the box.
Yes, of course.
It is time for bed.
Oh, you are there.
How was that possible?
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
But that is nothing to us.
What have they done?
Oh, nothing.
Yes, but only for you and me.
He had made up his mind.
It was a kind of language between us.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
And sit in the dark?
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Let her wait.
What brought you here?
You must have a rest.
Do you have my note?
The snow is deep.
It is very clear.
Come, and we can rest together.
He will sleep an hour.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
All right then, sit down.
Yes, she could sing that.
and so he decide he go back home.
Oh, this is too much.
The night was dark.
Oh, no.
Wonder if he has a name.
I hear his voice in the house.
It stood behind the door.
Yes, very well.
Then he must be a wonder.
We must be quick.
My mind was soon made up.
Yes, what is it?
Do you see that island?
Free to do what?
Nothing is more simple.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
And yet you said he had money.
Oh, all right.
Never mind me.
Yes, there it is.
Yes, she said.
Did she fall?
She began to cry.
Never mind how he came here.
Be back in a minute.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Decide if you are going back home.
But how long ago?
The night was very dark.
Oh, take me with you.
There is no one in that room behind you.
You better stay here all night.
Try to sleep.
And he told you nothing?
Are they on foot?
What has he done?
Better sit still.
Well, of course.
All that for nothing?
It was a cold, dark night.
You can hear that, miss?
Oh, come now.
They would cry.
Lead me to him.
In a minute.
What is done is done.
How can a little dog laugh?
Sit down, he said.
Is it certain?
He had, to be sure, done much.
Yes, he said, all of it.
She was still game.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Oh, he is so kind.
Of course it might.
Let him go free?
Yes, all right.
Money is power.
Nothing had come of it.
Oh, man.
She got her hand free.
Then it is certain?
Money is no object?
He saw nothing.
Yes, to be sure.
Bring them here.
Behind my bed.
Never mind that.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Oh, of course.
Come quick.
Get to bed.
How was it done?
Yes, go and find out.
What has brought you here?
It is a real bed.
Oh, very well, he said.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
See what you have done.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Can it be possible?
There is your old bed.
You must stay.
They need a rest.
He began to laugh.
Yes, but what did she say?
Clear my name.
This is a test.
Leave the rest to me.
Play the game out.
Go back to bed.
Good to rest once in a way.
It must be done.
All was dark.
Go and rest.
Why should my father fly?
The water ran dry.
That is a fact.
It was done.
Yes, it is true.
Perhaps he did.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Of course she will.
His first cry was for his father.
Take good note of it.
Yes, once.
It is nothing.
This voice was that of my father.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Oh, do the best you can.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Is it possible?
Why did you bring him here?
Just go to sleep.
How long ago?
Oh, that is very simple.
You will fall.
The city was soon behind me.
Go in there and drive them out.
Quick, friend, quick.
Wonder is it like that.
Well, there he stood.
Look at that dark water.
And then the game began all over again.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Yes, and no.
Oh, do as you like.
It was a record run.
Keep clear of him.
But it must be done soon.
Well, what about my plan?
Clear the way.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
It is done.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Of course it is.
That was well done.
He was here a minute ago.
This made him wonder more and more.
That would be a fine thing.
Did it all rest on me?
It is certain.
Nothing at all.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
The old man gave no answer.
Nothing new under the sun.
It was a warm night.
But they could see nothing.
Dont laugh.
What a game.
Oh, just listen.
Oh, if men only knew.
And here is the note.
His plan is very simple.
Did she stay long?
Yes, he said.
Who brought you up?
Like these in shape and size?
Yes, said the old man.
Fine, very fine.
Who gave it to you?
Her voice was low.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Is my father in town?
Well yes, you are right.
But never mind that.
It was full of people.
It was a dark night.
Answer me that, miss.
You knew it, and said nothing?
It is possible.
Nothing could be more simple.
Oh, but you were there?
Oh, how can you sleep?
It was a very dark night.
It was right in front of us.
Then lead the way.
The whole night the tree stood still.
There is nothing more to be said.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Well, miss?
He never said nothing.
You could see there was a story behind it.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Oh, to be sure.
The whole day had been hot.
Is that possible?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
