Where do you live?
How old are you?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Well, how are you?
Well then, what do you want?
Say no more about it.
Is it all right?
Now, go home.
But he is right.
Why, what do you mean?
But what did you want?
You must tell me.
And how old were you at that time?
That was a good time.
Why are they here?
Too much in the way.
Go and try.
They had all been very good to us.
It is very high.
Where is he?
Think no more about that.
Well, read it.
Why did he come?
What did he tell you?
We must come back.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
You must take me with you.
There she is again.
Then why are you here?
Where did he come from?
this one, too?
Here it is.
Do you think so?
One, two, three.
All right, then.
But where is it?
Now we see the light.
But why do you ask?
Try it on.
Show me the way he went.
How on earth do you know?
And what was his name?
What does she want?
Are they like each other?
Turn this way.
Come with me, then.
What do you mean?
Are you here for good?
That is just my point.
Can you help me find my way?
You can help me here.
There, that does me good.
Is that right?
That was a house to look at.
Come with me to the little house.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
What does it all mean?
You know, you see right through people.
He was at work again.
You must come now.
No, mother.
Ask him to show up?
And they went home.
For how much?
Well, how did it go?
Just like me.
No, tell me.
Do you want me to do it?
For some man.
And a very good thing, too.
Put it on.
Is he big?
Think it over.
And what is her name?
What does one live for?
Show me the way.
Well, did he?
In what part of the house?
Why are you here?
This is the man.
Here it is, he said.
Where are you?
Too much for me now.
He went on his way.
What have you been after?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Such as what?
What do they say was the cause?
Are you at it again?
There is no one here to see.
He was there too.
Do you know me?
What was it you said to me?
Will you try?
Why is that?
Do you think so now?
Look at it other way round.
Here is the way we put in the time.
Say no more.
Why do you want to know?
And where is he now?
Good day to you.
Just look through it.
Why is he here?
But he does so need a mother.
How can you tell?
Where does he live?
Who will tell her?
Where to, now?
But what does it mean?
There will just be time.
What could she mean by it?
Get to work.
If you want to know, go and find out.
What do you want me to do?
And what did he say?
She has a house?
Where are we?
Where are you from?
Well, go on.
How did you get here?
Are you back again?
Get out and play.
The first act was over.
Where do they get that?
Much good that would be.
And what about your mother?
Where is he now?
And how did you find out?
What does she think about me?
What do you want?
You were near him.
This for me?
She has been with him many long years.
Will you take me to her?
How can you find out?
What a good thing it would be.
Come with me.
After three, he said.
Tell me who made the world.
This is my point.
It is very kind of you.
What does all this mean?
What was his name?
Where in the world did you come from?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Read that, she said.
How could she say such a thing.
What could set you off in the first place?
She had to tell him.
Give him air.
See, here it is.
Is there no one who can help me?
Now tell me.
They want more.
Is it any good?
Where are you off to?
He is at my house.
Do you think she was?
All in good time.
Is it you or me?
Where did you place it?
And that was the end of it.
You are right.
Very well, show him to me.
What will you say?
Will you come with me?
He said that that would help.
That is right.
Large or small?
Why are you like this?
Tell me about it.
You think so?
And it did me good.
where did she come from?
What do you think of her?
How do you take it?
Here she is.
What do you play?
And where is this man?
Why, what is it, then?
What you have just said is good, very good.
It will take a little time.
Then will come our time.
Now it was time to act.
Give me your hand.
Would you now like to look round my place?
And where is she, then?
What did you say that for?
There is the little boy.
He will ask for it.
But who was your mother?
What do you think of this?
Well, and is that all?
And how in the world did you find them?
She went on.
What more could a man ask for?
What on earth does this mean?
Take this and this.
He has more to give.
Who are these men?
But it is just so with the world.
And what will they do with us?
You are most kind.
What do you think of him?
What on earth do you mean?
And have you been here long?
What will each of you give?
Think of him.
How does he use it?
Is it large?
The world is before you.
What did you say your name was?
Well then, tell him so.
What is that in your hand?
You are a good boy.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
And where is it?
Well, here he is.
What do you want to ask these people?
How can you say that?
He was here.
Have you been here long?
He will live.
And where was the place?
But why do you ask me?
Been back long?
What did he say?
Time to get out.
Who is that man?
Well, and what do you think?
He said too much.
It would be very kind of you.
Come and help me.
When will it take place?
Well, what do you think about it?
Now where did they come from?
And why is that?
At your house?
Where are we to turn for help?
Hand it in.
Well, all right.
You will get on in the world.
Tell us your name.
What do you mean by that?
You see it every day.
Where are they off to now?
This is the first act.
That is right, said the old man.
We are who we say we are.
Follow me, said the man.
That is all one can say about her.
I would like to see her again in that.
What does he mean?
But what about me?
But where are we to go?
How much do you want?
When will her mother come?
Which house is it?
How did you get me out?
She was right.
Where have you been?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Is this the man?
Very well, he said.
Why do you want water?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
do you come from the end of the world?
What would you have me do?
You are all very kind to me.
Give me a light.
Take some, she said.
He went to him.
See, they are here.
He was so kind.
How does she use you?
Give me my work.
Give me more than that
Now come here.
There is more to tell.
Can you take me?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Is it as good now?
It is great.
Move on, then.
Think what you will.
Tell me all about it.
How much are they?
Ask her, he said.
Read that, he said.
Is she well?
Where could he be?
How long have you been here?
Did you tell him?
It is all the same.
They are here.
Play with them.
We are here.
Just look at her.
And what do you think?
It was high time.
How did that help you?
But where is he?
That is the end of her.
But you must.
Tell me his name.
Give it me.
How can you think of such a thing?
And do you know why?
Some day you may ask me about it.
There was work to do.
Is he a good man?
What do they want?
In what year?
She came up to them.
Only two there now.
Good, he said.
Three, he said.
It must be where you put it.
Then they will follow you?
Is there some for me?
There is no place like home.
It is the same thing.
Now, you know me.
Is that all you want?
Good day, one and all.
You can say what it is.
Where have they been?
Give it to me, then.
Well, tell me.
Call me what you will, he said.
Then what kind is it?
Get out of the way.
Say what you want.
We will say no more about it, then.
When will he come back?
That was very good.
take them all.
Can you point it out to me?
Here is my hand.
But this is the point.
You think so, too?
Too much of this.
And who is the man?
Well, what do you think?
And in she went.
Now, what do you want with me?
There was no one near.
What is your name?
She was the cause of it all.
Were you here before me?
And off we go.
To what end?
And what did she say?
Do it for me.
What is his name?
How old was she?
Where is she?
Tell us all about it.
there are only two.
Very well then.
What do you think of that?
And what are they made of?
Look at me.
That would be very good.
Show it to me.
What is in your hand?
