For how much?
Now come here.
Where is he now?
Do it for me.
Will you come with me?
Come with me, then.
How much do you want?
Follow me, said the man.
Very well then.
We must come back.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
How long have you been here?
What on earth do you mean?
This is the man.
She went on.
And what was his name?
She has a house?
where did she come from?
Think it over.
Where is she?
All in good time.
Give me my work.
And how old were you at that time?
That is all one can say about her.
What did he say?
Too much for me now.
And why is that?
Where in the world did you come from?
Very well, he said.
The world is before you.
What do you think of that?
And off we go.
Call me what you will, he said.
Is it large?
But why do you ask me?
Are you here for good?
But what does it mean?
That is just my point.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
What does all this mean?
Give me your hand.
Do you think so?
do you come from the end of the world?
And they went home.
Just look through it.
Is it you or me?
And that was the end of it.
Where have they been?
Play with them.
How can you find out?
What do you mean?
How do you take it?
Give me more than that
Now tell me.
Take some, she said.
Will you take me to her?
What is that in your hand?
Read that, he said.
But who was your mother?
Here she is.
That would be very good.
It was high time.
What do you think of this?
He was here.
That was a good time.
You can say what it is.
Where is he?
Tell me who made the world.
Ask her, he said.
See, here it is.
He was there too.
For some man.
Give me a light.
And how did you find out?
Where could he be?
What does he mean?
What did he tell you?
There she is again.
It would be very kind of you.
Where are you?
And it did me good.
What do you mean by that?
And where was the place?
Did you tell him?
Where are they off to now?
You know, you see right through people.
Think what you will.
But where is it?
Well, read it.
Is that all you want?
Well, tell me.
What does she think about me?
There, that does me good.
Why is that?
take them all.
If you want to know, go and find out.
I would like to see her again in that.
Why are you like this?
And what will they do with us?
How much are they?
What would you have me do?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Well then, what do you want?
That is right, said the old man.
To what end?
How on earth do you know?
Turn this way.
Such as what?
Think of him.
Hand it in.
Why are you here?
Come with me.
Now where did they come from?
We will say no more about it, then.
After three, he said.
Get to work.
Some day you may ask me about it.
It is very kind of you.
Good day, one and all.
And where is he now?
And what are they made of?
Well, all right.
Show me the way he went.
Now we see the light.
But he is right.
What do you play?
He will live.
And in she went.
They want more.
Well, go on.
Where did you place it?
This is the first act.
That was very good.
Is it any good?
There was work to do.
Why is he here?
And where is it?
Time to get out.
Then they will follow you?
And do you know why?
But this is the point.
Where are you from?
Where to, now?
Think no more about that.
Here it is, he said.
You will get on in the world.
Been back long?
There is no place like home.
But where are we to go?
What does she want?
Why do you want to know?
Now, go home.
Give it to me, then.
Say no more.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
When will her mother come?
Tell us all about it.
Then will come our time.
What do you want?
Put it on.
They had all been very good to us.
She came up to them.
In what year?
Why are they here?
What could she mean by it?
Here it is.
This is my point.
What is in your hand?
What do they say was the cause?
Well, how did it go?
Get out of the way.
That is the end of her.
This for me?
Where are we?
Is he big?
How can you tell?
How does he use it?
Are you back again?
Where have you been?
Where do you live?
Is it as good now?
You can help me here.
Good day to you.
What on earth does this mean?
Why, what is it, then?
Where are we to turn for help?
And what about your mother?
Try it on.
What was his name?
What will each of you give?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
What is his name?
You are right.
Why do you want water?
Good, he said.
Just look at her.
That is right.
Well, and what do you think?
And where is this man?
Can you point it out to me?
She has been with him many long years.
Is he a good man?
When will it take place?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Look at it other way round.
Give it me.
There was no one near.
Just like me.
Is there some for me?
There is the little boy.
What did you say your name was?
How old was she?
You were near him.
Where did he come from?
Where are you off to?
Were you here before me?
It is the same thing.
Do you know me?
What was it you said to me?
There is no one here to see.
Would you now like to look round my place?
See, they are here.
She had to tell him.
Are you at it again?
Show it to me.
What do you think of her?
They are here.
You are a good boy.
How did you get me out?
Only two there now.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Look at me.
this one, too?
How does she use you?
In what part of the house?
And who is the man?
Is it all right?
What will you say?
You must take me with you.
Well, did he?
Read that, she said.
Is there no one who can help me?
And how in the world did you find them?
It was now his turn to look about him.
Tell me all about it.
Well then, tell him so.
Who will tell her?
It will take a little time.
Show us where you live, said the man.
When will he come back?
We are who we say we are.
That was a house to look at.
Here is the way we put in the time.
Large or small?
What does it all mean?
Come with me to the little house.
Can you help me find my way?
It is all the same.
Well, what do you think?
What have you been after?
And what is her name?
What do you want to ask these people?
Where do they get that?
Say what you want.
He is at my house.
Now, what do you want with me?
Take this and this.
Then why are you here?
Now it was time to act.
Well, here he is.
What could set you off in the first place?
The first act was over.
You are all very kind to me.
Here is my hand.
Ask him to show up?
There will just be time.
How can you think of such a thing?
Three, he said.
Much good that would be.
He has more to give.
Do you think she was?
Very well, show him to me.
He said too much.
He will ask for it.
He was at work again.
Well, how are you?
Is that right?
Where does he live?
What do they want?
And what did she say?
There is more to tell.
Then what kind is it?
But he does so need a mother.
Go and try.
Too much in the way.
Who is that man?
Who are these men?
Can you take me?
Get out and play.
Tell me about it.
You must tell me.
You think so?
How can you say that?
What you have just said is good, very good.
No, mother.
But what did you want?
Well, and is that all?
Do you think so now?
Tell us your name.
One, two, three.
He said that that would help.
there are only two.
What more could a man ask for?
And a very good thing, too.
What is your name?
But you must.
Too much of this.
How did that help you?
Is this the man?
What did you say that for?
Have you been here long?
And what did he say?
But what about me?
Move on, then.
Will you try?
It is great.
She was the cause of it all.
At your house?
What a good thing it would be.
Now, you know me.
He went to him.
He went on his way.
Tell me his name.
And what do you think?
How did you get here?
And where is she, then?
Show me the way.
You are most kind.
Give him air.
All right, then.
But it is just so with the world.
It is very high.
Which house is it?
It must be where you put it.
Are they like each other?
What do you want me to do?
You think so, too?
No, tell me.
How could she say such a thing.
But why do you ask?
And have you been here long?
Why did he come?
Is she well?
What does one live for?
You see it every day.
How old are you?
She was right.
Why, what do you mean?
Say no more about it.
What do you think of him?
He was so kind.
Come and help me.
We are here.
Do you want me to do it?
But where is he?
Well, what do you think about it?
You must come now.
