Ask her, he said.
Here it is, he said.
But he does so need a mother.
Say no more about it.
Good, he said.
What does one live for?
Turn this way.
Why did he come?
No, mother.
Been back long?
Why do you want to know?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Where are we to turn for help?
And have you been here long?
Is it as good now?
Do you want me to do it?
Very well then.
Well, how did it go?
He was so kind.
What was his name?
Who is that man?
In what part of the house?
Where does he live?
Come with me.
You must come now.
But what does it mean?
They had all been very good to us.
How does he use it?
Is she well?
It would be very kind of you.
Good day to you.
Give me my work.
You think so, too?
Why is that?
Go and try.
And off we go.
Tell us your name.
You are a good boy.
Only two there now.
Can you take me?
That is right, said the old man.
No, tell me.
Then what kind is it?
Say what you want.
Where in the world did you come from?
Where are you?
Tell me all about it.
And how did you find out?
How much do you want?
Read that, he said.
For some man.
What did he say?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Were you here before me?
Where could he be?
What on earth do you mean?
For how much?
When will it take place?
What is in your hand?
What is your name?
Where to, now?
But he is right.
take them all.
What does she want?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Well, go on.
How old was she?
Say no more.
Now it was time to act.
Why do you want water?
Come and help me.
This is the first act.
She came up to them.
He is at my house.
How did you get me out?
It will take a little time.
Tell us all about it.
Then will come our time.
Do you think so now?
See, here it is.
She was right.
You think so?
Such as what?
What do you think of her?
How could she say such a thing.
In what year?
How much are they?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
She has been with him many long years.
Show it to me.
That was a house to look at.
It was high time.
And what did she say?
Give him air.
He was at work again.
Well, did he?
I would like to see her again in that.
Too much for me now.
Is it large?
He said too much.
Then why are you here?
Do it for me.
She has a house?
Tell me his name.
That was a good time.
Where do they get that?
That was very good.
Come with me, then.
How old are you?
The world is before you.
Play with them.
Why, what is it, then?
Just look at her.
What did he tell you?
Are you here for good?
How did that help you?
Time to get out.
Why are you here?
One, two, three.
And they went home.
That is the end of her.
Would you now like to look round my place?
What do you want to ask these people?
You must tell me.
She was the cause of it all.
All right, then.
And who is the man?
Too much in the way.
Tell me who made the world.
What do you play?
Look at it other way round.
Are you at it again?
And what did he say?
He has more to give.
where did she come from?
there are only two.
Put it on.
Where is she?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Have you been here long?
You are most kind.
Some day you may ask me about it.
You must take me with you.
Three, he said.
Can you point it out to me?
Is he a good man?
How does she use you?
You can help me here.
And where is he now?
You were near him.
After three, he said.
Where do you live?
To what end?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
You see it every day.
What do you mean?
What is that in your hand?
Is it any good?
What more could a man ask for?
Think what you will.
And where was the place?
But you must.
Follow me, said the man.
And how old were you at that time?
And in she went.
But why do you ask?
And what is her name?
It is very high.
Well, what do you think about it?
Do you think so?
Take this and this.
Where have they been?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
But why do you ask me?
What would you have me do?
You are all very kind to me.
And what are they made of?
There is no one here to see.
What you have just said is good, very good.
Is there no one who can help me?
And what do you think?
Why, what do you mean?
They want more.
Where are you off to?
What do you want?
Are you back again?
There was no one near.
Give me your hand.
And that was the end of it.
Show me the way he went.
Come with me to the little house.
What will you say?
Think of him.
Ask him to show up?
But where is he?
What do they say was the cause?
It is all the same.
At your house?
What does she think about me?
Very well, show him to me.
But it is just so with the world.
Get to work.
Well, read it.
There is more to tell.
Read that, she said.
You know, you see right through people.
And it did me good.
Well, and is that all?
But what about me?
That is just my point.
And how in the world did you find them?
Where is he now?
There she is again.
And a very good thing, too.
Do you think she was?
Who are these men?
It is the same thing.
Call me what you will, he said.
Can you help me find my way?
What on earth does this mean?
All in good time.
this one, too?
You will get on in the world.
And why is that?
Well, and what do you think?
You are right.
Why are they here?
What does it all mean?
Now, you know me.
Too much of this.
He was there too.
It must be where you put it.
Where have you been?
Look at me.
How do you take it?
How on earth do you know?
Where are we?
And where is this man?
Much good that would be.
Here she is.
Give it me.
Tell me about it.
What could set you off in the first place?
It is great.
do you come from the end of the world?
Well, all right.
See, they are here.
Is it all right?
Well, here he is.
This is my point.
But who was your mother?
Hand it in.
That is all one can say about her.
Why are you like this?
Large or small?
What does all this mean?
Will you take me to her?
And where is it?
Give me more than that
You can say what it is.
That would be very good.
What do you think of that?
He will live.
Think it over.
Will you come with me?
Well then, tell him so.
There, that does me good.
Well, tell me.
Why is he here?
Now we see the light.
He said that that would help.
And do you know why?
Is there some for me?
Very well, he said.
Now, what do you want with me?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Get out and play.
What will each of you give?
What have you been after?
Here is the way we put in the time.
Where are they off to now?
That is right.
Where did he come from?
Well, what do you think?
How can you find out?
Just like me.
Now, go home.
He went to him.
Show me the way.
But where is it?
Now where did they come from?
Think no more about that.
What do you think of him?
Is this the man?
Do you know me?
What was it you said to me?
Get out of the way.
Try it on.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Then they will follow you?
How long have you been here?
She went on.
Good day, one and all.
Give me a light.
What do you want me to do?
Is that all you want?
What did you say your name was?
There is no place like home.
When will he come back?
But where are we to go?
How can you think of such a thing?
If you want to know, go and find out.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
We must come back.
It is very kind of you.
There was work to do.
Where is he?
But this is the point.
How can you tell?
Is that right?
Move on, then.
We will say no more about it, then.
She had to tell him.
The first act was over.
We are here.
Where did you place it?
Are they like each other?
Here it is.
Now come here.
He was here.
Take some, she said.
But what did you want?
There is the little boy.
They are here.
He will ask for it.
He went on his way.
What could she mean by it?
What did you say that for?
Where are you from?
Now tell me.
How did you get here?
When will her mother come?
How can you say that?
Just look through it.
This is the man.
Is he big?
And where is she, then?
Which house is it?
What do you think of this?
Well, how are you?
What do they want?
Give it to me, then.
Here is my hand.
What does he mean?
We are who we say we are.
What do you mean by that?
And what was his name?
Who will tell her?
Did you tell him?
What is his name?
Will you try?
What a good thing it would be.
Well then, what do you want?
Is it you or me?
There will just be time.
And what about your mother?
This for me?
And what will they do with us?
