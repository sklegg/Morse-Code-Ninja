It was a round table.
And you will always love him?
Can she sing?
Your watch is slow.
Ten, did you say?
The world is big enough.
You are right, young man.
He never heard.
Where he was, no one knew.
Do you remember me?
Did they ever go back?
But what did we ever get for it?
Has she any family?
Can it be true?
The rock was very small.
Do you love me?
Are you ready to play?
You were told.
Why do we love?
You saw the person?
Let me hear from you soon.
What can happen?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
And so they knew that it was true.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
She is fast?
How soon will he be here?
Have you heard?
Put down three and carry five.
You know me well enough.
What will happen to us?
Now, listen.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Do you remember?
This money was for her.
A better man than you.
Let me see him, said the young man.
Against what side?
That must be true.
You are better than that.
Who was it told me his name?
What have you heard?
If you only knew.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Never heard of it.
Does he love you?
But he never heard me.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
An hour and a half.
That is very simple.
She is the first person in this house.
Then get ready at once.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
We must try to find him, said the girl.
You are in love with me?
Your true father?
You had better go.
We must make the best of it.
You are on a ship?
But she is very young.
But listen to me.
You are a good girl.
You are cold.
But why must you leave me so soon?
But let that pass.
And serve them right.
It was true to life.
What is there to talk about?
So the question was, what to do?
Read them, said the King.
Pass this way, then.
Do you love her much?
Do you remember him?
Let me also ask you a question.
Are you here on leave?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
This is my body.
Well, young man?
We will talk about that.
What size do you want?
And how did he make his money?
Is it true?
She told me all about it.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Have you told her?
How does this happen?
It is a fire.
What a state he was in.
No more money?
You can pass through the door.
She is much better.
Had you heard?
That is enough.
You remember the place, my father?
What does he feel?
Half a mile?
You may go, said the King.
Let us pass.
Ask them to sing one more song.
Remember that time?
But enough of this.
So we came down this road.
We are ready.
How did this happen?
Young man, you will go far.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
It is true.
Leave me out of the question.
Take notice.
You must travel.
Are we ready?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
That is enough for me.
Much of it was true.
Have you heard from him often?
They had heard all that before.
Half as many is too much.
He said, the work is now complete.
you must step out.
The dog is always with him.
Then you will know me better.
It is the rule.
Did you get any money?
And will you direct us?
But listen to this, he said.
She was only a little girl.
She is very plain.
What kind of a bird?
In an hour?
Listen to them, he said.
This was true.
Never heard of him.
There are four hundred?
An example would be better.
Listen to him.
We had better go in.
He said, get him out of the road.
You may leave the room.
Pull it more to your side.
He had my love.
We knew them both.
We had a list.
Take a hold of it.
You must leave that to me.
It was all she could do to hold in.
There was no wind.
That may be true.
How far from the body?
And that is the whole point.
Five young children.
Now listen to me.
You love him?
Who told you so?
Why do you serve?
But how simple it is.
And what does she want the money for?
Never heard of it before.
Where did they get the money from?
You have an hour.
They had much to talk about.
It has been there ever since.
And why do you serve?
Look to the west.
We were up early.
He will leave me.
Are you better?
Let this man pass.
Which king?
And you can sing?
We got her half way.
No, he is a man about my size.
How short his time.
They knew it.
Little girl, where have you been?
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Are you all ready?
Do you know that old lay?
Can you sing?
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
Try it on the dog first.
How does it feel?
He is better than any of you.
Are you still cold?
Do you own a dog?
Light my fire.
To know her is to love her.
It was cold.
Take good care of the little girl.
So do you, my love.
Did you tell him your whole story?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
It is a rock.
Do you want any money?
Keep in step.
Then what would happen?
The night was cold.
They can have all our half of the house.
They had several children.
They told me to.
Better cross here.
Hold it up to the light.
Leave any for him?
Let us leave them, she said.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
who told you you could?
Have you a family?
They left in the morning.
It is a young girl.
She was so young, too.
He never told us what it was she said.
Long and the short of it.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
And dont talk to me.
Every word you said was heard.
Who told you that?
Where are you off to so early?
Is the wind north or south?
Answer me this one question.
He knew them.
That would be the best way.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
As soon as you left, it began.
This is simple.
He is very simple.
Why do they want to make her sing?
In short, take me.
you should know her better than me.
Pull together.
It is cold.
Are you in love with her?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Leave off that.
When did this happen?
Better write it here.
She had very little notice from him.
The King Went to him.
They all heard me.
It would be better if you went to the war.
Are they made to order?
How do you feel now?
That was the question.
I have no children to love me.
Let me remember what he said.
We serve them.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Why talk to me?
What will happen now?
Is your family well?
Made me feel so young.
It can never happen.
You will soon know.
And so they began to talk.
What have you against me now?
Fire and water, earth and air.
If you know it, that is enough.
That is true.
Will you answer that question?
We took our leave early, and left together.
She knew at once.
Hold her hand.
It will interest you, said he.
No, my love.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
We dont know enough.
Well, are you ready?
When do you leave?
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Let that pass.
He has money.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
He had enough of it.
you know better than that.
Let us talk a little about my father.
He got it this morning.
Better late than never.
That was the rule, she said.
Ten will be early enough.
One other question, said he.
She told me to ask you.
Listen to me.
They are still young.
Does she go fast?
Listen to this, will you?
She knew what was good for children.
You are right, my love.
A house is on fire?
On fire, on fire.
No less, no more.
And then he told all he knew.
Is your man white or black?
How many children did he leave?
And you are still so young.
Is that true?
Long live the king.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
A young man?
Did he though?
She was a good girl.
How do you feel?
Had they been heard?
It would have been more simple.
But one day you must feel it.
what could be better?
The night was cold and still.
This will pass in no time.
You will always love him?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
She must be told.
It was true.
Why did it happen?
How could that happen?
The family was at home.
Before you leave, tell us.
Are you ready?
From then on it was war between them.
What do you mean by that question?
Let us talk about you.
Was he young or old?
What a question.
Feel better then.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
We call it black.
About the usual time.
What is love?
He put his hand over part of the map.
