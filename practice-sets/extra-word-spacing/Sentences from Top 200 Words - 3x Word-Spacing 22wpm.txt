There she is again.
Read that, he said.
You are a good boy.
Is it all right?
And who is the man?
But why do you ask?
And in she went.
Were you here before me?
Have you been here long?
What could she mean by it?
But where are we to go?
He said too much.
What does he mean?
What did you say that for?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
What is his name?
there are only two.
How did that help you?
And how did you find out?
And have you been here long?
Is it any good?
Now come here.
Read that, she said.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Hand it in.
Such as what?
But this is the point.
They want more.
Are they like each other?
When will he come back?
What on earth does this mean?
Go and try.
She has been with him many long years.
It is very high.
And what about your mother?
take them all.
How old was she?
Look at me.
Where is he now?
Think it over.
Now tell me.
For how much?
Where have they been?
And how in the world did you find them?
Who are these men?
How does she use you?
Good day to you.
Try it on.
Why are they here?
Get out and play.
Very well, he said.
And what did she say?
where did she come from?
Too much for me now.
Where is he?
Give it me.
How do you take it?
Tell us all about it.
What do they say was the cause?
Say no more about it.
There is no one here to see.
Three, he said.
Do you think so now?
Call me what you will, he said.
Can you take me?
It would be very kind of you.
Why is that?
How on earth do you know?
You will get on in the world.
That is all one can say about her.
Tell me his name.
She was the cause of it all.
And what did he say?
We are here.
And a very good thing, too.
Do you think she was?
Well, and is that all?
And where is he now?
She came up to them.
Time to get out.
And what will they do with us?
What do you mean by that?
One, two, three.
That is the end of her.
Give me your hand.
There is the little boy.
How can you find out?
Very well then.
Much good that would be.
See, they are here.
Is it large?
That is just my point.
They had all been very good to us.
Just like me.
Is it you or me?
But why do you ask me?
Turn this way.
Good day, one and all.
Well, all right.
How long have you been here?
She has a house?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Here she is.
What did he say?
No, mother.
Get to work.
All in good time.
No, tell me.
Been back long?
You are all very kind to me.
Then will come our time.
Tell me all about it.
How can you tell?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Where do they get that?
You think so, too?
What is your name?
How much are they?
But where is it?
Give me a light.
But it is just so with the world.
Well, did he?
But where is he?
Then what kind is it?
And do you know why?
She went on.
Why is he here?
Which house is it?
That is right.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Now we see the light.
You were near him.
Well, here he is.
But who was your mother?
I would like to see her again in that.
What does one live for?
Large or small?
What will you say?
What does it all mean?
How did you get here?
What is in your hand?
Is there no one who can help me?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
What do you want?
Too much in the way.
He was there too.
What on earth do you mean?
There is no place like home.
Here it is, he said.
Well, read it.
What more could a man ask for?
Where are you off to?
Why do you want to know?
And what is her name?
Take some, she said.
What does she think about me?
In what part of the house?
Where does he live?
What was his name?
Do you know me?
They are here.
Well, how are you?
And that was the end of it.
How can you say that?
Where are we?
Give me my work.
He was at work again.
How much do you want?
Is she well?
Now where did they come from?
Why, what do you mean?
Only two there now.
And where was the place?
Where did he come from?
Show it to me.
What do you think of her?
It is very kind of you.
Is this the man?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Are you at it again?
Here is my hand.
That is right, said the old man.
Well, what do you think?
Can you point it out to me?
What a good thing it would be.
Here it is.
See, here it is.
She was right.
She had to tell him.
Think of him.
Is there some for me?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
What do they want?
It is all the same.
There, that does me good.
This for me?
Where is she?
What will each of you give?
Give it to me, then.
But what does it mean?
There is more to tell.
Come with me, then.
That was very good.
Why do you want water?
In what year?
Why are you like this?
Now it was time to act.
What is that in your hand?
And why is that?
We must come back.
Now, what do you want with me?
Did you tell him?
Come and help me.
That would be very good.
And where is this man?
Look at it other way round.
Ask her, he said.
Are you back again?
He went to him.
Where in the world did you come from?
This is my point.
You can say what it is.
Ask him to show up?
But he is right.
And how old were you at that time?
What do you want to ask these people?
And where is she, then?
Where could he be?
He will ask for it.
Good, he said.
Follow me, said the man.
He has more to give.
Where are you?
Then why are you here?
Where did you place it?
Say no more.
We will say no more about it, then.
Play with them.
He said that that would help.
But what about me?
And what are they made of?
What does she want?
Give me more than that
You think so?
Tell us your name.
What do you think of this?
Too much of this.
What do you mean?
Would you now like to look round my place?
How can you think of such a thing?
Is he a good man?
Now, go home.
But you must.
At your house?
How could she say such a thing.
If you want to know, go and find out.
Well, what do you think about it?
What you have just said is good, very good.
What did he tell you?
Show me the way.
There was work to do.
For some man.
Why, what is it, then?
Just look through it.
Then they will follow you?
Why did he come?
Think no more about that.
this one, too?
Here is the way we put in the time.
How does he use it?
You know, you see right through people.
When will it take place?
He will live.
Very well, show him to me.
Give him air.
Say what you want.
Where do you live?
Well then, what do you want?
When will her mother come?
You must take me with you.
Show me the way he went.
Do you think so?
And what was his name?
It is the same thing.
It is great.
Is that all you want?
And where is it?
Just look at her.
The world is before you.
What do you think of that?
The first act was over.
Can you help me find my way?
What does all this mean?
That was a good time.
You can help me here.
What have you been after?
We are who we say we are.
You are most kind.
You must tell me.
Do you want me to do it?
To what end?
And they went home.
Why are you here?
What would you have me do?
What do you play?
Well, and what do you think?
Will you take me to her?
All right, then.
Is that right?
What could set you off in the first place?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
There was no one near.
This is the man.
That was a house to look at.
You see it every day.
How did you get me out?
Where are you from?
He was so kind.
Well, tell me.
What do you think of him?
Where to, now?
Will you try?
He went on his way.
He is at my house.
Come with me to the little house.
do you come from the end of the world?
It was high time.
How old are you?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Put it on.
Now, you know me.
Get out of the way.
Who is that man?
Will you come with me?
You must come now.
What did you say your name was?
Who will tell her?
Where have you been?
What was it you said to me?
You are right.
Tell me who made the world.
Where are we to turn for help?
Some day you may ask me about it.
Take this and this.
Move on, then.
Think what you will.
And off we go.
Well, how did it go?
Tell me about it.
After three, he said.
Well, go on.
Are you here for good?
Come with me.
This is the first act.
It will take a little time.
Where are they off to now?
Do it for me.
Is he big?
He was here.
But what did you want?
Is it as good now?
It must be where you put it.
But he does so need a mother.
Well then, tell him so.
And what do you think?
There will just be time.
And it did me good.
What do you want me to do?
