When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Why should my father fly?
All that for nothing?
Oh, nothing.
Let us sit down.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Fly, my friend.
Here is our plan.
and so he decide he go back home.
Hold on a minute.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
He will sleep an hour.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
What is done is done.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Wonder if he has a name.
She gave me her hand.
You must stay.
Clear the table.
Better sit still.
And here is the note.
Yes, he said, all of it.
It is all done.
Yes, very well.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Keep clear of him.
Who brought you up?
Then all was dark again.
We brought them in.
It is nothing.
But what must be done?
It must be done at once.
Again came the voice.
In a minute.
If only they would be quick.
He must wait.
He ran up to them.
Oh, man.
What is power?
He must be in the same boat as us.
Half the town was there.
Be back in a minute.
We are free to act and think.
Nothing could be more simple.
The snow is deep.
Is it possible?
And what a voice she has.
It was very dark.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Oh, no.
Play the game out.
Get to bed.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
My mind was soon made up.
It is his voice.
It was done.
It was a very dark night.
A fine thing too.
Yes, once.
Oh, that.
Yes, he said.
Yes, but only for you and me.
In that town there is a street.
There is nothing more to be said.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
She heard and saw nothing.
Of course it is.
Laugh, if you will.
Perhaps he did.
is it come yet?
Go back to bed.
Oh, come now.
Well, sit down.
Clear my name.
It was right in front of us.
Oh, do you know?
The night was very dark.
Oh, take those off.
Go and rest.
But it must be done soon.
Let him go free?
It is no use, said a voice.
They would cry.
What has he done?
Oh, but you were there?
Quick, friend, quick.
Decide if you are going back home.
It stood behind the door.
Wonder is it like that.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
But they could see nothing.
Oh, to be sure.
He brought it with him for us to see.
See what you have done.
The whole day had been hot.
Come quick.
People might know my voice and find me out.
No, nothing at all.
His will be done.
They know nothing about it.
There is a lot of people.
And you can do nothing until then?
Will you rest here a little?
Yes, and no.
All was dark.
How long would you keep me in town?
Yes, go on.
He is in the box.
Yes, she could sing that.
Never mind me.
Are you strong?
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Then he must be a wonder.
But that is nothing to us.
All right then, sit down.
But what then must be done?
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Well yes, you are right.
Nothing could have been better.
It is time for bed.
Well then, be quick.
Let her wait.
Well, what about my plan?
My mind is made up.
Which box do you mean?
Yes, she was back.
His plan is very simple.
Did she stay long?
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
The little boy lay in his bed.
It was a record run.
And yet you said he had money.
Well, there he stood.
No, nothing of the kind.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Where can you wait for me?
Money is power.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Oh, that is very simple.
Very well, wait a minute.
She was still game.
It is done.
Yes, that was a picture book.
It must be done.
The island was a mile long.
Fine, very fine.
Is that a fact?
Nothing new under the sun.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Bring it here.
He never said nothing.
What have they done with my work?
If you fall dont wait to get up.
What have they done?
Bring them here.
It was brought to me.
What kind of voice is it?
It was so very long ago.
It is a real bed.
What brought you here?
Well, what does that lead up to?
Look at that dark water.
Of course she will.
They need a rest.
Nothing had come of it.
She got her hand free.
Did it all rest on me?
Nothing at all.
Yes, you are right.
Wait for me.
It was a warm night.
Free to do what?
Is he in bed?
Do you talk in your sleep?
She began to cry.
Answer me that, miss.
Is my father in town?
It was a long time before she could sleep.
He stood up.
Of course it might.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Oh, do as you like.
This voice was that of my father.
This made him wonder more and more.
Wait and see.
At his side was a large green box.
There is no possible way.
Yes, all right.
It might have done me good.
You can sleep here.
Clear the way.
She could think of nothing more to say.
It is certain.
Money is no object?
How can a little dog laugh?
It was a cold, dark night.
They all fall to the ground.
Her voice was low.
Yes, sit down.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Yes, that is true.
Nothing she can eat?
What can be done?
Oh, you are there.
It was hot.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Yes, but what did she say?
Well, miss?
Sit down, said the old man.
Oh, do the best you can.
Let me see your plan.
He saw nothing.
Yes, what is it?
He has a good voice still.
Wait a minute.
Well, of course.
Nothing is more simple.
Are they on foot?
It was full of people.
It was a kind of language between us.
Wonder what he does.
You must stay with me.
You better stay here all night.
Bring this with you.
Why did you bring him here?
He was here a minute ago.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
But how long ago?
Never mind that.
Is it certain?
Well, but where can he fly to?
Do you have my note?
Well, sit down by me.
Yes, said the old man.
Oh, of course.
But wait a minute.
Of course they will.
Sit down, he said.
Oh, just listen.
What age is he?
Oh, take me with you.
You could see there was a story behind it.
You love a certain person.
Yes, go and find out.
They call him a fine boy.
Just go to sleep.
But never mind that.
Who gave it to you?
But she is nothing to me now.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
He had made up his mind.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
There is your old bed.
You knew it, and said nothing?
I hear his voice in the house.
Do you see that island?
Yes, she said.
Then lead the way.
The night was dark.
Oh, dont ask me.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
There was more to be done.
And then the game began all over again.
Did he fall?
Never mind how he came here.
That is a fact.
Yes, there it is.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Your voice is that of a young man.
You know you must say yes.
What a game.
Of course he was right.
Now we must wait.
Then bring them to me, she said.
The water ran dry.
Oh, how can you sleep?
You must have a rest.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
You brought no one with you?
Did she fall?
He knew nothing.
Oh, tell me.
Oh, very well, he said.
Oh, he is so kind.
Oh, all right.
That is possible.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
How is that done?
It has to be done.
And sit in the dark?
He left long ago.
Dont laugh.
We must be quick.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
He gave me this paper.
You know nothing about it.
Can it be possible?
The old man gave no answer.
It was a dark night.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
How was it done?
Try to sleep.
Stay where you are.
Yes, he did.
Leave the rest to me.
All of this was possible.
His first cry was for his father.
Yes, of course.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Yes and no.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Is that possible?
Yes, we know that.
Help me sit up.
Yes, it is true.
How was that possible?
There is no one in that room behind you.
You are free to do so.
Behind every book is a man.
Wait a second.
What has brought you here?
And what have you done to me?
Good to rest once in a way.
Go in there and drive them out.
Oh, if men only knew.
He is among us.
It is very clear.
It was so long ago.
Just let us go free.
It was cold and dark.
There, by the wheel.
Take good note of it.
Yes, my love?
Like these in shape and size?
You can hear that, miss?
Oh, this is too much.
Yes, to be sure.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Why, of course.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
What did the letter contain?
How long ago?
That would be a fine thing.
Lead me to him.
And yet you are the better off?
It is possible.
We are more strong together.
Oh, go on.
That was well done.
You will fall.
Come, let me show you my plan.
What more is to be done?
Oh let me in.
Then it is certain?
You are in my power.
Come, and we can rest together.
He began to laugh.
Behind my bed.
The city was soon behind me.
Yes, it did.
What have you done?
And he told you nothing?
But let us see your plan.
This is a test.
