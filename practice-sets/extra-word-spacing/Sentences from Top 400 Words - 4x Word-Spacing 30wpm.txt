They had several children.
She was so young, too.
Let me also ask you a question.
Why talk to me?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
But enough of this.
Are they made to order?
She is the first person in this house.
How do you feel now?
But why must you leave me so soon?
Have you a family?
On fire, on fire.
You have an hour.
Take a hold of it.
you know better than that.
Let us leave them, she said.
Now, listen.
As soon as you left, it began.
You can pass through the door.
In an hour it will be at the door.
It is true.
What do you mean by that question?
Does she go fast?
Is your man white or black?
Are you ready to play?
Little girl, where have you been?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Then get ready at once.
It was a round table.
He is better than any of you.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Have you heard from him often?
It is the rule.
Do you love me?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
When do you leave?
And you can sing?
Well, young man?
Are you all ready?
They had much to talk about.
There are four hundred?
What a question.
Did they ever go back?
It is a rock.
Hold her hand.
Ask them to sing one more song.
You are on a ship?
Better late than never.
Against what side?
Try it on the dog first.
And so they began to talk.
How many children did he leave?
How do you feel?
Let us talk a little about my father.
Never heard of it.
The night was cold and still.
Let me hear from you soon.
In short, take me.
That would be the best way.
Who told you so?
Are we ready?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
They can have all our half of the house.
One other question, said he.
She is fast?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
What will happen to us?
About the usual time.
The family was at home.
Then you will know me better.
Are you still cold?
Ten, did you say?
It was true.
If you only knew.
Feel better then.
She knew what was good for children.
You were told.
That was the rule, she said.
Who was it told me his name?
This is simple.
But one day you must feel it.
And you are still so young.
Did he though?
No more money?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
You saw the person?
You are in love with me?
It would be better if you went to the war.
How far from the body?
You are right, my love.
She was only a little girl.
He never heard.
Listen to me.
Long and the short of it.
This is my body.
There was no wind.
Is the wind north or south?
I have no children to love me.
That is very simple.
Do you want any money?
But he never heard me.
To know her is to love her.
No less, no more.
Ten will be early enough.
Does he love you?
Why do they want to make her sing?
He put his hand over part of the map.
It can never happen.
And how did he make his money?
And dont talk to me.
You may leave the room.
What is love?
You will always love him?
You are right, young man.
Take notice.
We must make the best of it.
And will you direct us?
The rock was very small.
We serve them.
We had a list.
It was cold.
Listen to him.
Why do we love?
That is enough.
Let me remember what he said.
This was true.
No, my love.
How does it feel?
She had very little notice from him.
Leave any for him?
Now listen to me.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
That is true.
Let this man pass.
When did this happen?
Every word you said was heard.
But listen to me.
What a state he was in.
Is your family well?
You had better go.
Pass this way, then.
She is much better.
No, he is a man about my size.
Pull it more to your side.
You must leave that to me.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Are you better?
Remember that time?
And so they knew that it was true.
He will leave me.
So the question was, what to do?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
You may go, said the King.
Then what would happen?
She was a good girl.
Let us talk about you.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
How soon will he be here?
You love him?
Can you sing?
And what does she want the money for?
A young man?
Let that pass.
He knew them.
An hour and a half.
Had you heard?
You had better come to my house, said the man.
you should know her better than me.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
He said, the work is now complete.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Did you tell him your whole story?
She must be told.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Leave me out of the question.
Are you ready?
Do you remember me?
The dog is always with him.
Hold it up to the light.
Is it true?
Is that true?
Do you know that old lay?
It is cold.
The night was cold.
You are a good girl.
It is a fire.
Never heard of him.
So do you, my love.
But what did we ever get for it?
Take good care of the little girl.
We had better go in.
We will talk about that.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
It was true to life.
We dont know enough.
She told me all about it.
Do you love her much?
How short his time.
Do you own a dog?
Where he was, no one knew.
Have you told her?
What is there to talk about?
He got it this morning.
Young man, you will go far.
Had they been heard?
Have you heard?
That must be true.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
You know me well enough.
Fire and water, earth and air.
Better cross here.
We call it black.
Look to the west.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
She knew at once.
And why do you serve?
How could that happen?
Better write it here.
They told me to.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Let me see him, said the young man.
He has money.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
What can happen?
Do you remember?
It was all she could do to hold in.
Which king?
He is very simple.
What kind of a bird?
Where are you off to so early?
Are you in love with her?
So we came down this road.
And serve them right.
It will interest you, said he.
They had heard all that before.
Much of it was true.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
That is enough for me.
Where did they get the money from?
What have you heard?
Can she sing?
Was he young or old?
Are you here on leave?
That was the question.
What size do you want?
Pull together.
How did this happen?
Who told you that?
Will you answer that question?
He never told us what it was she said.
Half a mile?
From then on it was war between them.
Let us pass.
Listen to this, will you?
They left in the morning.
And then he told all he knew.
You are better than that.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
What have you against me now?
Made me feel so young.
What does he feel?
Why did it happen?
Put down three and carry five.
She told me to ask you.
He had enough of it.
They all heard me.
Half as many is too much.
They knew it.
Leave off that.
We got her half way.
An example would be better.
Has she any family?
They are still young.
Your true father?
What will happen now?
Light my fire.
Well, are you ready?
If you know it, that is enough.
Your watch is slow.
How does this happen?
Never heard of it before.
you must step out.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
The King Went to him.
But how simple it is.
Five young children.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
We knew them both.
A house is on fire?
Before you leave, tell us.
She is very plain.
We were up early.
But she is very young.
And you will always love him?
We are ready.
And that is the whole point.
Did you get any money?
It would have been more simple.
But listen to this, he said.
what could be better?
It has been there ever since.
Read them, said the King.
who told you you could?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Keep in step.
You remember the place, my father?
Why do you serve?
He said, get him out of the road.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Do you remember him?
Listen to them, he said.
That may be true.
He had my love.
You will soon know.
You must travel.
In an hour?
This money was for her.
The world is big enough.
Long live the king.
It is a young girl.
But let that pass.
You are cold.
This will pass in no time.
Can it be true?
Answer me this one question.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
A better man than you.
