How long has he been there?
But when will that be?
What is it about?
When was that?
You know how it is with her.
You know more than we do.
Who are you?
How is he now?
What was he like?
What do you see?
who, then, are you?
The time had come.
What is there to see?
What do you make of that?
Call him in.
And who is this?
We have no water.
But what are you up to?
Do you know her?
Or so they said.
Did you see her?
What is it like?
What is it for?
How did you know about it?
No one will come, she said.
Now you know.
And what do you make of it?
Is she like him?
Do as you like.
And what is that?
Is that all?
How can it be?
There he is, do you see him?
Did you know him?
What do they call you?
Then who are you?
Would you like some?
what is it?
Look at it this way.
So that was the way.
Then make it up.
Then there is more to do.
What have you come for?
Will you come and see her?
Had to look the other way.
Look over it.
That is a long time.
What are we to do?
Which is it?
There you are, he said.
What can this be?
There were two of them.
When was it?
So it was.
One or two?
And is that all?
Who was that?
But it was of no use.
How did he do it?
What was it about?
Did you see it?
So there it was.
But will he see it?
Do you know what it is?
Then what is it?
Is he there?
Is it time?
And who was that?
and so on, and so on.
And do you like her?
May we come in?
Who and what are you?
How can you know?
Are you there?
what has she to do with it?
He said no.
But how about you?
Tqhen you may go.
There he is, she said.
So be it.
Would you do what he did?
That will do, he said.
So it is.
Come this way.
But WHAT DID you see?
But what have they been up to?
Look at him.
What is all this?
What did he do to you?
At what number?
And what do you call her?
Is it over?
Has it come to this?
Who will go first?
That was all she said.
You can go.
but there was more to it than this.
It was from you.
Now what are we to do with you?
What are you up to?
Who was he?
And could she see him?
Can you do that?
Can it be?
Can one see from there?
We have him.
The time will come.
Do you see it?
who can it be?
How is she?
What did you do then?
Did you know her?
At what time?
You can have some.
Do you know what you look like?
What would she have said?
but what if it is?
Is that her?
Who is she?
How are you?
What do you make of it?
You have it.
How is he?
How do you do?
How was that?
Out of the way.
And what did you do then?
Do they know him?
That was it.
But what will you do?
They said no more.
What is it all about?
And who are you?
There they are.
But what is it?
Now there is no more to be said.
How did you come by it?
Do you know?
How did she do it?
Look at them.
She has it.
What can we do, then?
And what did you see?
You may go.
Did you know them?
What is he like?
And all for what?
That is what she did.
What was it?
And has it come to this?
But he had no time.
Is that it?
There is but one thing to do.
Then what are you up to now?
But it has been so long.
But he had to have it.
But how is that?
And when will you call?
There he is, you see.
but we can go and see.
How would you like to have it?
What other way is there to look at it?
Do as you will.
And do you like him?
And how did you find out?
Do you see him?
What DO you know of him?
Will that do?
What could it be?
Go on, he said.
But who was she?
No was there one?
Do you like him?
You have them?
What time is it?
When is it?
Look at it.
Do you know him?
And what was it for?
are you there?
Now is your time.
That will do, said he.
Then how many are there?
Is it like him?
But so it is.
What will you do, then?
What is that?
What did they do?
You can do it.
Then, how do you know?
There you are.
It was from you.
There he is, you see.
Is she like him?
But he had no time.
Look at it.
How was that?
Who is she?
Do you know what it is?
Who was he?
But what have they been up to?
You can do it.
There he is, do you see him?
What was he like?
No one will come, she said.
But what is it?
That will do, he said.
Look at them.
How can it be?
But how about you?
And what is that?
We have no water.
They said no more.
How did you know about it?
Do you see it?
How did she do it?
and so on, and so on.
but what if it is?
How are you?
What is it for?
But what will you do?
So that was the way.
Now what are we to do with you?
And who is this?
We have him.
How long has he been there?
One or two?
but there was more to it than this.
But it was of no use.
Do you know?
Then there is more to do.
But when will that be?
Can it be?
Is he there?
That is a long time.
How is he now?
Is it time?
And could she see him?
And do you like him?
Do as you will.
How do you do?
And has it come to this?
And what was it for?
When was that?
Would you like some?
Now is your time.
You have it.
So it is.
Then how many are there?
She has it.
Out of the way.
What was it about?
Do they know him?
What did he do to you?
And what did you see?
Do you know her?
What did you do then?
Look at it this way.
And who was that?
What do they call you?
Had to look the other way.
What could it be?
You may go.
That was it.
What do you see?
How is she?
Do you know what you look like?
And what did you do then?
Who was that?
There he is, she said.
That will do, said he.
There were two of them.
What time is it?
Do you see him?
And how did you find out?
When was it?
That was all she said.
There you are.
Has it come to this?
You can have some.
Did you see it?
who can it be?
What do you make of it?
And what do you make of it?
What is he like?
And is that all?
And what do you call her?
Who will go first?
What other way is there to look at it?
Can you do that?
Call him in.
May we come in?
but we can go and see.
Now you know.
No was there one?
What is that?
So it was.
There is but one thing to do.
How is he?
But what are you up to?
How did he do it?
Tqhen you may go.
You can go.
What are we to do?
That is what she did.
What can this be?
And all for what?
who, then, are you?
How would you like to have it?
And who are you?
What was it?
Do as you like.
Which is it?
what is it?
What would she have said?
What can we do, then?
Is it over?
But it has been so long.
Then, how do you know?
The time will come.
Do you know him?
But he had to have it.
There you are, he said.
What is it like?
But how is that?
But will he see it?
What have you come for?
What will you do, then?
But WHAT DID you see?
Can one see from there?
When is it?
Did you know them?
Then what are you up to now?
Did you know her?
Did you see her?
Who are you?
Do you like him?
But so it is.
What is it about?
Then what is it?
Who and what are you?
There they are.
At what time?
are you there?
Then who are you?
Would you do what he did?
Is that all?
What do you make of that?
Look over it.
You have them?
Is that her?
Look at him.
What is there to see?
And do you like her?
What is all this?
At what number?
Then make it up.
But who was she?
So be it.
And when will you call?
Now there is no more to be said.
What is it all about?
How did you come by it?
Are you there?
Did you know him?
What DO you know of him?
Is that it?
What are you up to?
Is it like him?
what has she to do with it?
Will that do?
Or so they said.
He said no.
Go on, he said.
Come this way.
The time had come.
So there it was.
You know how it is with her.
How can you know?
Will you come and see her?
What did they do?
You know more than we do.
