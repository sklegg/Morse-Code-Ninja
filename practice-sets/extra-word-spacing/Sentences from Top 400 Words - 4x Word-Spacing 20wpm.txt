You are a good girl.
Read them, said the King.
Then what would happen?
That was the question.
Are you still cold?
Why do they want to make her sing?
That is enough for me.
You had better go.
Take notice.
And so they began to talk.
You are cold.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Who told you so?
Why did it happen?
Do you know that old lay?
It was true.
Hold her hand.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
It was all she could do to hold in.
Do you love her much?
We call it black.
And you can sing?
Do you remember him?
But listen to me.
Do you remember me?
It was cold.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
Had you heard?
And you are still so young.
Never heard of it before.
Ask them to sing one more song.
We had a list.
This was true.
Leave any for him?
He had enough of it.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
How far from the body?
What a question.
Better write it here.
They all heard me.
It is the rule.
It is true.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
This is my body.
Remember that time?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
you must step out.
If you only knew.
She told me to ask you.
Do you own a dog?
Have you a family?
Did they ever go back?
Take good care of the little girl.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Are you here on leave?
It is a fire.
When do you leave?
He had my love.
An example would be better.
It would be better if you went to the war.
You are right, young man.
What is there to talk about?
They are still young.
Feel better then.
Is it true?
Try it on the dog first.
Are you in love with her?
Ten will be early enough.
Can she sing?
Let us pass.
The rock was very small.
And serve them right.
Before you leave, tell us.
Let me hear from you soon.
you know better than that.
The dog is always with him.
She is fast?
How do you feel now?
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Are you ready?
They had several children.
We will talk about that.
What have you against me now?
Are they made to order?
They knew it.
What do you mean by that question?
It was a round table.
If you know it, that is enough.
I have no children to love me.
It has been there ever since.
On fire, on fire.
But how simple it is.
You love him?
Did you tell him your whole story?
Let that pass.
Does she go fast?
She is the first person in this house.
He never heard.
No more money?
Are you ready to play?
Are you all ready?
It was true to life.
You will always love him?
To know her is to love her.
Is your family well?
Made me feel so young.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
They can have all our half of the house.
We got her half way.
But what did we ever get for it?
That is true.
Have you heard?
Five young children.
Do you love me?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
What is love?
you should know her better than me.
Has she any family?
There was no wind.
Look to the west.
That may be true.
Pull together.
You may leave the room.
Your watch is slow.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Listen to me.
That would be the best way.
She was so young, too.
Never heard of it.
Leave off that.
And will you direct us?
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
She is very plain.
This money was for her.
Let us leave them, she said.
Have you told her?
And dont talk to me.
Let this man pass.
And that is the whole point.
So do you, my love.
Can it be true?
Did you get any money?
What will happen now?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
Is the wind north or south?
They left in the morning.
How does it feel?
And why do you serve?
She knew what was good for children.
Are we ready?
That is very simple.
Keep in step.
Let me also ask you a question.
who told you you could?
Which king?
The King Went to him.
You have an hour.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Half a mile?
Listen to them, he said.
In an hour?
That is enough.
Where are you off to so early?
That was the rule, she said.
We knew them both.
How short his time.
She is much better.
Pull it more to your side.
But he never heard me.
You remember the place, my father?
So the question was, what to do?
Then get ready at once.
And then he told all he knew.
It can never happen.
Long and the short of it.
Better cross here.
What can happen?
Listen to him.
Where did they get the money from?
How does this happen?
He knew them.
They told me to.
It would have been more simple.
One other question, said he.
You are in love with me?
Are you better?
No less, no more.
The family was at home.
Let me see him, said the young man.
Have you heard from him often?
It is cold.
A young man?
That must be true.
Well, young man?
And what does she want the money for?
They had much to talk about.
It is a young girl.
How could that happen?
Put down three and carry five.
It will interest you, said he.
A better man than you.
She had very little notice from him.
Much of it was true.
This is simple.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
Young man, you will go far.
She told me all about it.
What does he feel?
Let us talk about you.
The night was cold.
Little girl, where have you been?
Your true father?
A house is on fire?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Was he young or old?
Well, are you ready?
Had they been heard?
How do you feel?
We dont know enough.
You may go, said the King.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Answer me this one question.
What kind of a bird?
She was a good girl.
Take a hold of it.
Will you answer that question?
But let that pass.
And how did he make his money?
He will leave me.
How soon will he be here?
It is a rock.
The night was cold and still.
They had heard all that before.
Listen to this, will you?
Is that true?
Who was it told me his name?
Hold it up to the light.
The world is big enough.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
You saw the person?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
About the usual time.
Why talk to me?
Now, listen.
Did he though?
Then you will know me better.
This will pass in no time.
Why do you serve?
Pass this way, then.
She knew at once.
Let me remember what he said.
No, my love.
Better late than never.
We are ready.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
You will soon know.
Light my fire.
Does he love you?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
How many children did he leave?
You must leave that to me.
Why do we love?
But why must you leave me so soon?
We had better go in.
We serve them.
You must travel.
He put his hand over part of the map.
He never told us what it was she said.
So we came down this road.
Is your man white or black?
Long live the king.
Who told you that?
Now listen to me.
Let us talk a little about my father.
He said, get him out of the road.
In short, take me.
No, he is a man about my size.
We must make the best of it.
You can pass through the door.
What will happen to us?
But enough of this.
Do you want any money?
You know me well enough.
Half as many is too much.
You were told.
He said, the work is now complete.
From then on it was war between them.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
Never heard of him.
We were up early.
And you will always love him?
Do you remember?
He got it this morning.
Leave me out of the question.
She was only a little girl.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
But listen to this, he said.
When did this happen?
Ten, did you say?
Fire and water, earth and air.
Against what side?
But one day you must feel it.
Where he was, no one knew.
He is better than any of you.
How did this happen?
There are four hundred?
Can you sing?
You are better than that.
what could be better?
He is very simple.
What size do you want?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
What have you heard?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
He has money.
An hour and a half.
And so they knew that it was true.
What a state he was in.
You are on a ship?
Every word you said was heard.
But she is very young.
She must be told.
You are right, my love.
As soon as you left, it began.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
