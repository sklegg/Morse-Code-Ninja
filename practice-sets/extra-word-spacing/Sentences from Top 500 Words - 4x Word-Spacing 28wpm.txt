Of course it might.
It was full of people.
The city was soon behind me.
Fly, my friend.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Oh, come now.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
What have they done?
Well, sit down by me.
It must be done at once.
She got her hand free.
Keep clear of him.
You must stay with me.
Then it is certain?
Is it certain?
There is nothing more to be said.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Hold on a minute.
Oh, take me with you.
He will sleep an hour.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Of course she will.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
We brought them in.
Oh, all right.
Do you have my note?
Go and rest.
Yes, she could sing that.
Oh, dont ask me.
Her voice was low.
You are free to do so.
Yes, you are right.
Yes, that is true.
Wait a second.
Well, sit down.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Get to bed.
Never mind how he came here.
Very well, wait a minute.
And then the game began all over again.
What more is to be done?
He was here a minute ago.
Dont laugh.
Oh, very well, he said.
It was a cold, dark night.
You love a certain person.
You are in my power.
Yes, it is true.
Yes, of course.
But how long ago?
Be quick, for the time is short.
Yes, very well.
Why, of course.
He gave me this paper.
Behind every book is a man.
Here is our plan.
This is a test.
Yes, sit down.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
What has brought you here?
It must be done.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
You can sleep here.
Yes, he said, all of it.
He must wait.
Oh, of course.
Wait for me.
She heard and saw nothing.
The whole day had been hot.
Oh, that.
It is a real bed.
All was dark.
It is done.
They all fall to the ground.
Well, there he stood.
No, nothing at all.
But it must be done soon.
A fine thing too.
Let her wait.
Well then, be quick.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
It is nothing.
Bring it here.
Come quick.
Clear my name.
Yes, that was a picture book.
You knew it, and said nothing?
Is he in bed?
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Never mind that.
It was a dark night.
Then all was dark again.
Oh, do as you like.
He had made up his mind.
What has he done?
Yes, and no.
You must have a rest.
Did she stay long?
Are they on foot?
Did it all rest on me?
Can it be possible?
Oh, go on.
Wait and see.
But they could see nothing.
Oh, this is too much.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Yes, we know that.
Yes, what is it?
You will fall.
Did he fall?
And sit in the dark?
What have you done?
How can a little dog laugh?
We must be quick.
Yes, all right.
Sit down, said the old man.
Clear the table.
Free to do what?
Answer me that, miss.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Well, what about my plan?
Again came the voice.
What a game.
Yes, he did.
My mind was soon made up.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Money is power.
Let me see your plan.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Oh let me in.
Is that possible?
All right then, sit down.
The whole night the tree stood still.
We are more strong together.
At his side was a large green box.
He has a good voice still.
I hear his voice in the house.
It is his voice.
Be back in a minute.
Nothing had come of it.
Go in there and drive them out.
Did she fall?
You better stay here all night.
What kind of voice is it?
Bring them here.
There, by the wheel.
Oh, no.
It was cold and dark.
Come, and we can rest together.
And here is the note.
Oh, tell me.
Do you see that island?
People might know my voice and find me out.
Oh, nothing.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
They call him a fine boy.
Oh, he is so kind.
Well yes, you are right.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Half the town was there.
Do you talk in your sleep?
His plan is very simple.
It was brought to me.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Yes and no.
Yes, my love?
It was a record run.
Oh, do the best you can.
Oh, take those off.
He must be in the same boat as us.
Behind my bed.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
You know nothing about it.
Oh, to be sure.
This made him wonder more and more.
In that town there is a street.
They need a rest.
Yes, but what did she say?
That would be a fine thing.
How was that possible?
Yes, once.
Yes, to be sure.
See what you have done.
All of this was possible.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
What age is he?
Oh, man.
Better sit still.
It is possible.
Where can you wait for me?
Fine, very fine.
Oh, that is very simple.
Money is no object?
Then he must be a wonder.
But wait a minute.
Wonder what he does.
Yes, she said.
Yes, she was back.
What have they done with my work?
Yes, it did.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
He began to laugh.
Of course it is.
It was a warm night.
Just let us go free.
and so he decide he go back home.
Of course he was right.
It stood behind the door.
There is no one in that room behind you.
And yet you said he had money.
His will be done.
The night was dark.
Let him go free?
Which box do you mean?
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
They know nothing about it.
He ran up to them.
Good to rest once in a way.
It might have done me good.
This voice was that of my father.
He knew nothing.
And what a voice she has.
He saw nothing.
The night was very dark.
What is done is done.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
He brought it with him for us to see.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Help me sit up.
The water ran dry.
Is my father in town?
They would cry.
Let us sit down.
Just go to sleep.
You know you must say yes.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Oh, if men only knew.
But she is nothing to me now.
Laugh, if you will.
Wonder if he has a name.
Oh, you are there.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
And what have you done to me?
Quick, friend, quick.
It was hot.
Of course they will.
Are you strong?
We are free to act and think.
You can hear that, miss?
Oh, but you were there?
It was right in front of us.
Yes, but only for you and me.
How long ago?
Then lead the way.
All that for nothing?
How long would you keep me in town?
Try to sleep.
Go back to bed.
Who brought you up?
There is your old bed.
In her name, then, let it be done.
And he told you nothing?
Yes, go on.
It was so very long ago.
Never mind me.
Like these in shape and size?
It was so long ago.
Nothing new under the sun.
His first cry was for his father.
That was well done.
How was it done?
It is all done.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
That is a fact.
Is it possible?
She began to cry.
It is no use, said a voice.
Take good note of it.
Well, what does that lead up to?
And you can do nothing until then?
Nothing she can eat?
There is no possible way.
How is that done?
The little boy lay in his bed.
Play the game out.
She gave me her hand.
But that is nothing to us.
He is in the box.
It is time for bed.
There is a lot of people.
Wonder is it like that.
It is certain.
It has to be done.
Come, let me show you my plan.
What is power?
If only they would be quick.
Nothing could have been better.
It is very clear.
Yes, go and find out.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Why did you bring him here?
The island was a mile long.
Sit down, he said.
Yes, said the old man.
Perhaps he did.
He left long ago.
Yes, there it is.
It was very dark.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
What did the letter contain?
Who gave it to you?
The snow is deep.
Will you rest here a little?
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Leave the rest to me.
Lead me to him.
But what must be done?
The old man gave no answer.
You must stay.
Oh, do you know?
is it come yet?
It was done.
Look at that dark water.
Wait for me here, all of you.
It was a very dark night.
Clear the way.
He is among us.
What brought you here?
No, nothing of the kind.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
He stood up.
And yet you are the better off?
Bring this with you.
In a minute.
That is possible.
Yes, he said.
But never mind that.
Oh, just listen.
Stay where you are.
Well, miss?
He never said nothing.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
But let us see your plan.
You brought no one with you?
Now we must wait.
My mind is made up.
It was a kind of language between us.
What can be done?
Nothing at all.
Nothing is more simple.
Wait a minute.
But what then must be done?
There was more to be done.
Decide if you are going back home.
Why should my father fly?
She was still game.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Well, of course.
Is that a fact?
Nothing could be more simple.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
You could see there was a story behind it.
