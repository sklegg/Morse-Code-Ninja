So take care of me.
What do you think when you hear music?
You should take me there one day.
This took him some time.
Keep to the right.
It is open?
No, never.
Let me hear what it is.
We must go at once.
Open the door.
Which end is his head?
It is always so.
Well, read the letter again.
Do we stop here?
No, dont.
There to the left.
Come, let us be men.
Do you know where he is?
He is my father.
But then you would be close to the sea?
Stop and think.
So they got out and went in.
Dont you think so?
They always know.
Where is this city?
He said at last.
No, said her father.
And now, good night.
Who should it be?
Take care.
Why should they?
How could you let him go so far?
It is from your father.
Which story was it?
Tell her to begin.
And your children?
It was white.
Let me out.
She came in just now by the back door.
The sun had set long since.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
She is my friend.
Let them have it.
We might learn a thing or two.
A call for help, you thought?
But then it will be too late.
Then, good night.
Give me the letter.
It was the last day of the year.
Dont you like it?
You must walk.
It was very hard.
That was the first night.
You got me?
Do you have the letter?
Who did you learn that from?
Let us cross over.
It must be in her own house.
Just cut it out, will you?
We got under way at last.
Did you see his eye?
Dont you see that?
What did you hear?
Where has she run off to?
Who can answer for that?
Stop, let me show you the way.
They never did it again.
We may be too late.
See him grow up.
You saw him?
That is the idea.
My father is right.
They dont care.
You are right, father.
But you must never tell.
Who said four?
But hard to tell.
Look at his face.
This is what began it all.
And then they began to fish.
But let us walk.
But it would be in the paper.
Who let you in?
He had only one night more to live.
How many children?
There is only food for one.
What is life to you?
Have you got it?
It is well thought of.
We got one and they got one.
He had two left feet.
Do you want some more to eat?
Come at once.
At last we have a man.
But it was very late.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Still, you never know.
Is my father here?
But it is all all too late now.
Off with his head.
Then let me have a word with you.
Ask one of those men.
Do you have a car?
A second man got up and went out.
She saw it.
We should look at this.
What do you think of the music?
Here is the book.
In the country?
Let me see it.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Tell us a story.
You must never tell.
Who was the letter from?
Do you hear that?
He came at once.
Always the same with you people.
What a night it has been.
Any book will tell you that.
Dont you want any?
How did it begin?
Have you never been there?
So, once more, good night.
No, why should he?
We never thought of that.
It was like new life to him.
What should he say?
Are you sure?
Let me hear your story.
Is it far?
Why is he cross with me?
Have you got that?
No one would have thought the end was so near.
She got up.
There are only four of us.
He has children of his own.
It is so very kind of you both.
Do you know what he did last night?
And who is this friend?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Only, dont look back.
She saw no one?
Here is the letter.
You must study.
The children will live just the same.
Let us start, then.
Let him answer us.
And there are four of you?
What was left of him?
And what did you learn from him?
She must have a hard time with him.
Where have you been this long while?
Let me go back.
Why should this be so?
You are sure of it?
Come eat with me.
Do you want to cross?
But you got to play music for them.
Just set still and take it like a man.
They are always the same.
We must begin again.
Do you often come back?
No, that can never be.
it took all that time to come over the water.
Are we too late?
He may come close.
There was no answer.
Let me get on with my work.
Dont say that to me.
Who could have thought it?
Keep to the left.
Write an answer.
What a start that was.
Point it at his horse.
It will be too late.
Say good night.
Keep watch all night.
Cut your hand open?
Stop, said he.
Can you stand?
Why do you stop here?
Have you been at sea?
This is real.
They may tell us to open it.
Take care of him.
Here is the paper.
One never has too much.
They never come back.
We dont see it like that.
Are you my friend?
Come let us see them.
Here he is at last.
But now it is too late.
Come over in the sun.
Never see him again.
Few had found it.
Think of my father.
He is always at it.
It is music.
Good night, friend.
We got to let that go.
You are sure of that?
He then said, It is time to start.
There was no letter for me.
One of us will be here all night.
It was then time to start.
Both of us.
Let me be and let me live.
You might want it.
Let us go back.
One was on a white horse.
Who found them out?
Let me go to the door.
She never came back.
Let me in.
Let me know at once when you will start.
Let me see him.
These were the first people we saw.
What is your real name?
And why should they?
Do you know how he made his mark?
Let me see her.
She might be at his house.
How could you begin?
Is there any answer?
Have you found it?
Now you must eat.
It is a long story.
Is it in the city?
Just a few.
Off with her head.
What was the name of the man who took it?
They came over last night.
It might help.
What country does he come from?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Just cut it out.
what river is it?
But watch over him.
Let him follow me.
Why dont you want to go?
Are we late?
How would they stop it?
He saw his men draw back.
Can you hear me?
Watch over him.
So it always was.
Do you hear me?
When did you begin?
What did he answer?
Our own people must come first.
That night we were just in time.
So he began to help.
Was you in my room?
How many are left?
What was it that you thought?
Good night again.
Is he a real father?
Let me see him at once.
For once you are right.
Let him grow up with you.
Why, it was one of his own men.
At this time of my life, no.
It was his own room.
Sure of what?
Let us go in.
She came over last night.
And now let us go home.
Will you never learn?
At four, she said.
Right here it began.
We are together.
They are hard at it.
But take care.
There were few near me.
There, do you hear?
They dont know their own country.
Where could you keep it?
This is my country.
But what did you hear?
You have a car?
He could run no more.
Let me have a word with you.
He is at sea.
But they may still come here.
First turn to the left.
Are you sure of it?
To the left.
How much have you got?
Is that far?
She is still here?
Why, dont you hear it?
If you know, why dont you tell?
Let me look.
Watch him, he said.
Dont tell me.
He might still be up.
Let me say one thing.
But it is the same with any life.
Let me get to work.
But why dont you want to take it?
The other night she left.
Cut him down.
Good for the country.
We are very far from that.
But she saw no one?
You found him?
Well, what next?
And then we may begin.
Why, is it late?
Always the same, year after year.
We were together.
Here we see the boy at school.
No, stop.
And he left the room.
It was the first thing he thought of.
No, said the Tree.
Now or never.
Dont move, he said.
Who took him out of it?
Now let me have it.
We found it.
This took place at his house, in his room.
What would you have me do with my life?
Life is all right.
He is my friend.
But are you sure of that?
And this food?
What do you hear?
Call the next one.
You must eat now.
Where is the river?
You took it.
What did he say in the letter?
Come here, my friend.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
And she left the room.
One night more and he would be on his way.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
We should ask him.
And what did you do with that letter?
You will answer for it.
Let her go.
Does he never go out?
Music is a good thing.
Why dont you play?
Go to your father.
By and by he got it.
He has been been found.
It would seem so.
Well, run back to her.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Tell me more.
