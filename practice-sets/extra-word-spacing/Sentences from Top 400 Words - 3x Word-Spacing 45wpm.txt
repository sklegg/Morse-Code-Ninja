Ten, did you say?
Are you still cold?
What does he feel?
Ten will be early enough.
And so they knew that it was true.
Listen to this, will you?
Pull together.
You had better go.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
You are on a ship?
You had better come to my house, said the man.
you must step out.
Let me hear from you soon.
you should know her better than me.
They had much to talk about.
Hold her hand.
Was he young or old?
Will you answer that question?
Do you love her much?
Let us talk about you.
Has she any family?
The dog is always with him.
She was a good girl.
Are you ready to play?
Better cross here.
you know better than that.
She knew at once.
Well, young man?
Take notice.
How do you feel now?
And will you direct us?
Let me remember what he said.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
And that is the whole point.
It can never happen.
As soon as you left, it began.
Which king?
Put down three and carry five.
And dont talk to me.
Leave me out of the question.
Why do you serve?
What can happen?
That is enough for me.
Did they ever go back?
Fire and water, earth and air.
Against what side?
That is enough.
Did you get any money?
He said, the work is now complete.
Young man, you will go far.
We got her half way.
We were up early.
How does it feel?
Listen to them, he said.
Are they made to order?
They told me to.
She is very plain.
Have you a family?
We will talk about that.
What will happen now?
Let me see him, said the young man.
what could be better?
Pass this way, then.
You may go, said the King.
Are you ready?
We dont know enough.
He had my love.
How many children did he leave?
Are you all ready?
We took our leave early, and left together.
Why did it happen?
What have you heard?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
It would have been more simple.
Feel better then.
He got it this morning.
It was cold.
It is a fire.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
But how simple it is.
Why do we love?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
If you only knew.
We had better go in.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
She knew what was good for children.
Every word you said was heard.
This is my body.
You are right, young man.
Who was it told me his name?
He has money.
Had you heard?
Ask them to sing one more song.
Listen to me.
Let us pass.
We call it black.
Now, listen.
Is your man white or black?
Half as many is too much.
Did he though?
There was no wind.
The night was cold and still.
Well, are you ready?
Leave any for him?
Your true father?
How far from the body?
There are four hundred?
He will leave me.
She is fast?
He never told us what it was she said.
The night was cold.
He is very simple.
What kind of a bird?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Can it be true?
They all heard me.
But he never heard me.
So do you, my love.
You will soon know.
That may be true.
It is a rock.
She had very little notice from him.
You are right, my love.
And you are still so young.
Then get ready at once.
Five young children.
He never heard.
The King Went to him.
She was only a little girl.
What is love?
This was true.
Long and the short of it.
What is there to talk about?
Then you will know me better.
Light my fire.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
That was the question.
We are ready.
Does she go fast?
It will interest you, said he.
The family was at home.
Do you remember?
She must be told.
Try it on the dog first.
That is very simple.
Never heard of him.
Better late than never.
Is your family well?
You remember the place, my father?
It is a young girl.
Is that true?
Had they been heard?
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
He had enough of it.
We had a list.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
You are in love with me?
To know her is to love her.
You were told.
One other question, said he.
It would be better if you went to the war.
Read them, said the King.
A house is on fire?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Long live the king.
So we came down this road.
You must travel.
But she is very young.
Can you sing?
Look to the west.
How short his time.
Where are you off to so early?
Half a mile?
Are you better?
Let us leave them, she said.
An example would be better.
You know me well enough.
It was true to life.
And what does she want the money for?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
What a state he was in.
Let this man pass.
In short, take me.
Before you leave, tell us.
Are we ready?
She is much better.
It is the rule.
In an hour?
But why must you leave me so soon?
You are a good girl.
Where he was, no one knew.
How could that happen?
But listen to this, he said.
Can she sing?
A better man than you.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
You must leave that to me.
And how did he make his money?
How does this happen?
No less, no more.
You love him?
You are better than that.
It is cold.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
He knew them.
You have an hour.
Have you told her?
When do you leave?
That must be true.
But let that pass.
Where did they get the money from?
Do you own a dog?
Do you love me?
She is the first person in this house.
You can pass through the door.
They are still young.
Do you remember me?
Your watch is slow.
Is the wind north or south?
They left in the morning.
From then on it was war between them.
And you can sing?
who told you you could?
Is it true?
We serve them.
It is true.
Have you heard from him often?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
If you know it, that is enough.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
No, he is a man about my size.
Did you tell him your whole story?
So the question was, what to do?
Remember that time?
Keep in step.
We must make the best of it.
That was the rule, she said.
In an hour it will be at the door.
You are cold.
Better write it here.
Let us talk a little about my father.
On fire, on fire.
It has been there ever since.
Take good care of the little girl.
This is simple.
And why do you serve?
That is true.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
Listen to him.
Made me feel so young.
When did this happen?
Then what would happen?
About the usual time.
It was a round table.
What a question.
Answer me this one question.
Leave off that.
But what did we ever get for it?
I have no children to love me.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
But one day you must feel it.
How soon will he be here?
Hold it up to the light.
Do you want any money?
Who told you so?
Let that pass.
The world is big enough.
Take a hold of it.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
And serve them right.
Much of it was true.
The rock was very small.
This money was for her.
She told me all about it.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Never heard of it.
Are you here on leave?
Do you know that old lay?
You saw the person?
No, my love.
And you will always love him?
You may leave the room.
An hour and a half.
She was so young, too.
How do you feel?
Who told you that?
But listen to me.
It was true.
What do you mean by that question?
That would be the best way.
Now listen to me.
He said, get him out of the road.
They can have all our half of the house.
Does he love you?
He put his hand over part of the map.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
This will pass in no time.
What have you against me now?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Pull it more to your side.
And then he told all he knew.
What size do you want?
Let me also ask you a question.
Why talk to me?
Little girl, where have you been?
She told me to ask you.
No more money?
Do you remember him?
It was all she could do to hold in.
Are you in love with her?
How did this happen?
Have you heard?
You will always love him?
We knew them both.
A young man?
What will happen to us?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
They had heard all that before.
They had several children.
And so they began to talk.
But enough of this.
He is better than any of you.
They knew it.
Why do they want to make her sing?
Never heard of it before.
