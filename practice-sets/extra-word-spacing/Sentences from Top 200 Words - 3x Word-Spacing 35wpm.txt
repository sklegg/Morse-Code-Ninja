He went on his way.
Where are we to turn for help?
where did she come from?
Now, go home.
The first act was over.
Do it for me.
Did you tell him?
You are right.
Well, what do you think?
We are who we say we are.
What could set you off in the first place?
Where is he now?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
This is the man.
Give him air.
And where was the place?
That is just my point.
Where in the world did you come from?
One, two, three.
Now, what do you want with me?
But who was your mother?
There is no place like home.
When will it take place?
Give it to me, then.
No, mother.
Well, how did it go?
Think of him.
Then will come our time.
Do you think so now?
Well, read it.
See, here it is.
Come with me, then.
How could she say such a thing.
What do you mean?
Such as what?
I would like to see her again in that.
She had to tell him.
But where are we to go?
Just look at her.
At your house?
You are all very kind to me.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
You must take me with you.
You must come now.
How can you say that?
And have you been here long?
Can you point it out to me?
What does he mean?
Do you think so?
Is this the man?
What do you think of that?
What could she mean by it?
Well, how are you?
Is there some for me?
Come with me to the little house.
This is the first act.
And what about your mother?
Where did he come from?
Is it large?
Tell us your name.
What is your name?
And how in the world did you find them?
Is that right?
Are you at it again?
And off we go.
They are here.
There is the little boy.
Look at me.
Show me the way.
And what will they do with us?
And it did me good.
Just look through it.
Well then, tell him so.
He was so kind.
What have you been after?
Well, what do you think about it?
Take some, she said.
do you come from the end of the world?
Why do you want to know?
Where is he?
But he does so need a mother.
It is great.
You must tell me.
Give me a light.
And in she went.
How did you get here?
Call me what you will, he said.
Are you here for good?
Why are you like this?
Hand it in.
And where is it?
Where to, now?
Just like me.
But what does it mean?
How do you take it?
But why do you ask me?
And who is the man?
Well, here he is.
Play with them.
take them all.
Where are we?
You were near him.
For some man.
How did that help you?
Can you help me find my way?
Say what you want.
Why did he come?
What did he tell you?
Who are these men?
Well then, what do you want?
He was there too.
Why are they here?
Do you know me?
Ask her, he said.
That was very good.
And what did she say?
Here is the way we put in the time.
Tell us all about it.
Good day, one and all.
Tell me all about it.
What on earth do you mean?
What does she think about me?
Give me more than that
Say no more.
Only two there now.
there are only two.
What do they say was the cause?
What do they want?
Do you think she was?
Why is he here?
Follow me, said the man.
You know, you see right through people.
She came up to them.
Tell me his name.
You are most kind.
Here it is.
What do you think of this?
How can you tell?
Well, and what do you think?
Here it is, he said.
Would you now like to look round my place?
Is he big?
What more could a man ask for?
Well, go on.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Some day you may ask me about it.
Too much for me now.
He went to him.
And where is he now?
Where have you been?
What do you want me to do?
When will her mother come?
Come with me.
The world is before you.
Now, you know me.
this one, too?
When will he come back?
No, tell me.
He will ask for it.
Read that, she said.
But this is the point.
Here she is.
You can say what it is.
Show us where you live, said the man.
Where does he live?
How on earth do you know?
It must be where you put it.
He has more to give.
Well, did he?
Very well, he said.
Is that all you want?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
What does she want?
That is right, said the old man.
You will get on in the world.
But he is right.
And they went home.
And where is she, then?
Is it any good?
How much do you want?
How long have you been here?
That is the end of her.
What is in your hand?
She has been with him many long years.
How did you get me out?
Take this and this.
Why, what do you mean?
He said that that would help.
There was no one near.
And what are they made of?
Very well then.
This for me?
Think what you will.
It was high time.
She has a house?
And why is that?
Give me your hand.
Who is that man?
Ask him to show up?
He was here.
How much are they?
Is there no one who can help me?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Then they will follow you?
Very well, show him to me.
What is his name?
They had all been very good to us.
And what is her name?
It is very high.
There is more to tell.
She was right.
How old are you?
Where did you place it?
In what year?
We are here.
Put it on.
How old was she?
Is it as good now?
Where are you from?
Large or small?
Look at it other way round.
Is it all right?
Now where did they come from?
Show it to me.
It is all the same.
What do you want?
Get to work.
Go and try.
Now come here.
And how did you find out?
How does he use it?
That was a good time.
What will each of you give?
We must come back.
What would you have me do?
Show me the way he went.
All right, then.
Read that, he said.
But what did you want?
Which house is it?
Why, what is it, then?
What did you say your name was?
What do you want to ask these people?
All in good time.
But what about me?
Where do they get that?
What does all this mean?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
How does she use you?
They want more.
There, that does me good.
Is it you or me?
What do you think of her?
She was the cause of it all.
It would be very kind of you.
Much good that would be.
Who will tell her?
Turn this way.
There is no one here to see.
It will take a little time.
There will just be time.
What do you think of him?
That is right.
Will you take me to her?
Now it was time to act.
Is she well?
But where is he?
What does one live for?
Now we see the light.
He will live.
How can you find out?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Tell me who made the world.
See, they are here.
Move on, then.
This is my point.
In what part of the house?
That was a house to look at.
Try it on.
Well, and is that all?
That is all one can say about her.
Come and help me.
Think it over.
You see it every day.
Well, tell me.
Do you want me to do it?
Now tell me.
What a good thing it would be.
He said too much.
Get out and play.
What on earth does this mean?
What you have just said is good, very good.
Why are you here?
You think so, too?
Then what kind is it?
Good day to you.
And do you know why?
And that was the end of it.
And what do you think?
Time to get out.
And what did he say?
Give it me.
Three, he said.
Have you been here long?
Why is that?
Where do you live?
But where is it?
What was his name?
It is the same thing.
You can help me here.
What did you say that for?
What was it you said to me?
To what end?
Good, he said.
Here is my hand.
There was work to do.
You think so?
Are you back again?
Where are they off to now?
Why do you want water?
And how old were you at that time?
Where have they been?
If you want to know, go and find out.
She went on.
What does it all mean?
Tell me about it.
How can you think of such a thing?
For how much?
And where is this man?
Where are you off to?
But why do you ask?
You are a good boy.
What did he say?
What will you say?
It is very kind of you.
There she is again.
Where could he be?
And what was his name?
Were you here before me?
But it is just so with the world.
Where are you?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Think no more about that.
Will you try?
He is at my house.
What is that in your hand?
We will say no more about it, then.
Too much of this.
What do you mean by that?
Too much in the way.
Where is she?
And a very good thing, too.
Is he a good man?
Get out of the way.
Are they like each other?
He was at work again.
Give me my work.
Say no more about it.
After three, he said.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Then why are you here?
Will you come with me?
But you must.
What do you play?
Can you take me?
Been back long?
Well, all right.
That would be very good.
