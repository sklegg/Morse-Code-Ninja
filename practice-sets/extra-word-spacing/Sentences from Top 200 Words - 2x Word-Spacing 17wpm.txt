Do you know me?
That is all one can say about her.
Tell us all about it.
Very well, he said.
Have you been here long?
Who are these men?
There was no one near.
Where does he live?
Well, here he is.
Where in the world did you come from?
What do you think of this?
He was here.
And what about your mother?
Just look through it.
He went to him.
Where are we to turn for help?
Why are you here?
How on earth do you know?
See, they are here.
We will say no more about it, then.
Very well, show him to me.
For how much?
Then will come our time.
How old was she?
You must come now.
Are you at it again?
Well, what do you think?
Can you point it out to me?
Is that all you want?
That was very good.
Here it is, he said.
Think what you will.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
You are right.
Then why are you here?
Well, what do you think about it?
Tell me his name.
Three, he said.
Would you now like to look round my place?
Follow me, said the man.
What was his name?
There is no one here to see.
Do you think she was?
But why do you ask me?
All right, then.
But what did you want?
What do you think of her?
And have you been here long?
What do you want me to do?
Well, how did it go?
Read that, he said.
And what did she say?
How old are you?
Where have you been?
Take some, she said.
Is this the man?
And where is this man?
It was now his turn to look about him.
Where do they get that?
Come with me to the little house.
What do they want?
How can you think of such a thing?
And that was the end of it.
But where is it?
And it did me good.
And what do you think?
At your house?
Well, all right.
Ask him to show up?
Why are you like this?
There is no place like home.
He has more to give.
She has been with him many long years.
And where was the place?
It is the same thing.
There will just be time.
He will live.
When will he come back?
What do you play?
And what is her name?
Are they like each other?
What does she want?
How much do you want?
Where do you live?
You know, you see right through people.
What was it you said to me?
What would you have me do?
What is your name?
What could set you off in the first place?
What do you mean?
What do you want?
What do you want to ask these people?
It will take a little time.
Just look at her.
where did she come from?
Where to, now?
He went on his way.
Is he big?
They want more.
What does she think about me?
How do you take it?
Well, and is that all?
The first act was over.
Is it any good?
Now tell me.
I would like to see her again in that.
But he is right.
Now it was time to act.
Is it you or me?
And what was his name?
Why do you want to know?
You must take me with you.
Why, what is it, then?
She was right.
What do you mean by that?
Now we see the light.
Time to get out.
How can you find out?
If you want to know, go and find out.
You see it every day.
Are you here for good?
You are a good boy.
Why is that?
Well then, tell him so.
You think so, too?
Well, and what do you think?
Good day, one and all.
Too much of this.
After three, he said.
Say no more about it.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Well, tell me.
She was the cause of it all.
That is right.
What is that in your hand?
Where are you from?
What will you say?
She went on.
Why are they here?
You were near him.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
When will it take place?
Good day to you.
There, that does me good.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
And what are they made of?
Where did he come from?
See, here it is.
How did that help you?
Which house is it?
Why is he here?
Well, read it.
But what about me?
That is the end of her.
But why do you ask?
Say no more.
Where are you off to?
What did you say your name was?
There is the little boy.
Hand it in.
But where are we to go?
You must tell me.
Is she well?
Say what you want.
This is the man.
Is it all right?
Where is he now?
Then what kind is it?
Look at me.
Then they will follow you?
The world is before you.
It is very kind of you.
She had to tell him.
How does he use it?
Who will tell her?
What could she mean by it?
there are only two.
What on earth do you mean?
Such as what?
Is he a good man?
He was there too.
That is just my point.
He is at my house.
Turn this way.
It would be very kind of you.
He was at work again.
We are who we say we are.
You can help me here.
Is there some for me?
Good, he said.
But who was your mother?
Been back long?
You will get on in the world.
It must be where you put it.
There is more to tell.
No, tell me.
And what did he say?
What on earth does this mean?
Now, you know me.
That would be very good.
That is right, said the old man.
Here she is.
And a very good thing, too.
How did you get me out?
What do you think of that?
Why do you want water?
Can you take me?
And in she went.
We are here.
What do you think of him?
Come with me, then.
Take this and this.
What does one live for?
Very well then.
Call me what you will, he said.
This for me?
How did you get here?
Are you back again?
To what end?
No, mother.
What a good thing it would be.
It is very high.
And what will they do with us?
What do they say was the cause?
And who is the man?
When will her mother come?
This is the first act.
Now, go home.
But it is just so with the world.
What have you been after?
Tell me who made the world.
Give it me.
Only two there now.
Come and help me.
take them all.
He will ask for it.
And where is he now?
Just like me.
We must come back.
Tell us your name.
Where could he be?
Where are you?
How can you say that?
Did you tell him?
What did he say?
Give me a light.
Ask her, he said.
And they went home.
Think it over.
Give it to me, then.
Here it is.
What does it all mean?
Think of him.
What more could a man ask for?
Tell me about it.
Will you try?
He said too much.
Will you come with me?
Where are we?
Why did he come?
You can say what it is.
One, two, three.
You think so?
Tell me all about it.
Think no more about that.
Show us where you live, said the man.
Well, did he?
Get out and play.
What does he mean?
Read that, she said.
She has a house?
What did he tell you?
Were you here before me?
Do you want me to do it?
Do it for me.
Too much in the way.
Some day you may ask me about it.
Where is she?
Give him air.
How does she use you?
Put it on.
It is all the same.
Move on, then.
But this is the point.
Play with them.
Give me my work.
He was so kind.
What you have just said is good, very good.
There she is again.
Show me the way.
Who is that man?
Now, what do you want with me?
Here is the way we put in the time.
And where is she, then?
Now come here.
And how old were you at that time?
What does all this mean?
She came up to them.
How much are they?
Is it as good now?
That was a good time.
What did you say that for?
Large or small?
Give me more than that
All in good time.
He said that that would help.
You are all very kind to me.
Too much for me now.
But what does it mean?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
But where is he?
It is great.
Why, what do you mean?
Come with me.
Do you think so?
How can you tell?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Is that right?
But he does so need a mother.
In what year?
this one, too?
What will each of you give?
Give me your hand.
Well, go on.
Go and try.
You are most kind.
They had all been very good to us.
There was work to do.
And do you know why?
Show me the way he went.
Do you think so now?
Where have they been?
This is my point.
Will you take me to her?
Show it to me.
Where is he?
And where is it?
Is there no one who can help me?
Get to work.
Much good that would be.
do you come from the end of the world?
And off we go.
Get out of the way.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Can you help me find my way?
In what part of the house?
Where are they off to now?
What is in your hand?
And why is that?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
But you must.
For some man.
Is it large?
Here is my hand.
Well then, what do you want?
How long have you been here?
Where did you place it?
And how did you find out?
They are here.
Try it on.
How could she say such a thing.
It was high time.
That was a house to look at.
Now where did they come from?
Look at it other way round.
What is his name?
And how in the world did you find them?
Well, how are you?
