What have you been after?
How long have you been here?
That is all one can say about her.
How did that help you?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Do it for me.
Tell me all about it.
He went to him.
Take some, she said.
Well, did he?
Then will come our time.
How did you get here?
It is all the same.
If you want to know, go and find out.
All in good time.
What is his name?
You must come now.
Are you here for good?
That is right, said the old man.
We are who we say we are.
Here she is.
What do they say was the cause?
Where are we to turn for help?
And what did he say?
What will each of you give?
Just look at her.
He is at my house.
Good day, one and all.
What did he tell you?
And have you been here long?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Why are you here?
Where did he come from?
And how did you find out?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Where are they off to now?
What does he mean?
Is it all right?
Where does he live?
Such as what?
Where are we?
Tell me his name.
And where is he now?
Now come here.
Well, and what do you think?
It was now his turn to look about him.
Do you want me to do it?
Well then, what do you want?
take them all.
Why, what is it, then?
Where to, now?
Now, go home.
After three, he said.
Give it me.
You think so, too?
Will you come with me?
One, two, three.
You must take me with you.
What you have just said is good, very good.
How do you take it?
What do you want me to do?
How did you get me out?
What did you say that for?
This is the first act.
Look at me.
Well, go on.
Now it was time to act.
Come with me to the little house.
How can you think of such a thing?
It is very high.
Will you try?
For some man.
Tell us all about it.
Tell us your name.
You are most kind.
Read that, she said.
But where is it?
You think so?
No, tell me.
It must be where you put it.
Why is that?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Why, what do you mean?
And a very good thing, too.
Too much of this.
Then what kind is it?
Get out of the way.
Call me what you will, he said.
What does she want?
Give me my work.
How old was she?
She was right.
No, mother.
But this is the point.
Where in the world did you come from?
Here it is.
There will just be time.
You were near him.
Much good that would be.
What is your name?
Is there no one who can help me?
What do you want to ask these people?
When will her mother come?
And where is she, then?
What do you play?
He was here.
Good, he said.
We must come back.
Can you help me find my way?
There was no one near.
But what does it mean?
Turn this way.
Where is he?
He has more to give.
Large or small?
Then they will follow you?
Hand it in.
And off we go.
What on earth do you mean?
Why do you want water?
Now, what do you want with me?
Is that right?
In what part of the house?
They want more.
That is just my point.
Give him air.
Where do you live?
And why is that?
That was a house to look at.
How much do you want?
It would be very kind of you.
Were you here before me?
Show me the way he went.
This is my point.
Only two there now.
He said too much.
Is there some for me?
It is very kind of you.
Would you now like to look round my place?
And they went home.
What does she think about me?
Very well then.
Can you take me?
But why do you ask?
What more could a man ask for?
Just like me.
Where are you?
there are only two.
They had all been very good to us.
He was at work again.
Now we see the light.
She came up to them.
How can you tell?
But it is just so with the world.
Follow me, said the man.
There is no place like home.
You must tell me.
She had to tell him.
Can you point it out to me?
There she is again.
What do you think of him?
Why are you like this?
Get to work.
Where could he be?
There was work to do.
Do you think so now?
Well then, tell him so.
When will he come back?
Is it any good?
Why is he here?
For how much?
Some day you may ask me about it.
Here it is, he said.
Well, tell me.
Did you tell him?
Where have you been?
Have you been here long?
Why are they here?
That was very good.
He will live.
And do you know why?
Do you know me?
And where is this man?
Show it to me.
But what about me?
They are here.
That is right.
What is in your hand?
Where did you place it?
What did he say?
Good day to you.
And where was the place?
What was his name?
And what will they do with us?
He went on his way.
How can you find out?
How much are they?
Now tell me.
Look at it other way round.
All right, then.
Well, all right.
What do you think of her?
Do you think she was?
And what did she say?
Move on, then.
Think it over.
Is he a good man?
Too much for me now.
Been back long?
What is that in your hand?
You can say what it is.
There is no one here to see.
Is it as good now?
See, they are here.
And it did me good.
Tell me who made the world.
Well, what do you think about it?
When will it take place?
You see it every day.
this one, too?
And where is it?
Very well, show him to me.
Are you at it again?
You are right.
Get out and play.
What do you mean by that?
Ask him to show up?
What do you think of this?
But he does so need a mother.
Just look through it.
And that was the end of it.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
You know, you see right through people.
Well, read it.
Well, here he is.
It is the same thing.
Think no more about that.
This is the man.
The first act was over.
I would like to see her again in that.
She was the cause of it all.
There, that does me good.
And what is her name?
What do you want?
What does all this mean?
Do you think so?
Who will tell her?
Then why are you here?
But you must.
It will take a little time.
Come with me.
Is it large?
Time to get out.
Is this the man?
Is he big?
Three, he said.
And what about your mother?
She went on.
And what do you think?
How can you say that?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
How does he use it?
Give me more than that
We are here.
But who was your mother?
He said that that would help.
Give me a light.
To what end?
You are all very kind to me.
Read that, he said.
Are they like each other?
Here is my hand.
What will you say?
Try it on.
Well, and is that all?
Well, what do you think?
And how in the world did you find them?
Say no more.
There is more to tell.
And what was his name?
What do you mean?
You are a good boy.
But why do you ask me?
You can help me here.
The world is before you.
What could set you off in the first place?
That is the end of her.
Now, you know me.
There is the little boy.
How on earth do you know?
Is she well?
Give it to me, then.
do you come from the end of the world?
He was so kind.
He will ask for it.
She has been with him many long years.
We will say no more about it, then.
It was high time.
Where is he now?
But where are we to go?
What would you have me do?
Why did he come?
Very well, he said.
Now where did they come from?
Is it you or me?
And in she went.
What did you say your name was?
How does she use you?
Well, how are you?
Will you take me to her?
What was it you said to me?
Who is that man?
Say what you want.
Give me your hand.
What does it all mean?
She has a house?
Put it on.
Ask her, he said.
He was there too.
What a good thing it would be.
Tell me about it.
What does one live for?
Come with me, then.
What on earth does this mean?
Well, how did it go?
But what did you want?
Go and try.
Where do they get that?
It is great.
Think what you will.
In what year?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
See, here it is.
You will get on in the world.
Come and help me.
That was a good time.
How old are you?
Why do you want to know?
Which house is it?
Take this and this.
Who are these men?
Where is she?
And what are they made of?
Show us where you live, said the man.
where did she come from?
And who is the man?
Is that all you want?
And how old were you at that time?
But he is right.
But where is he?
How could she say such a thing.
Where have they been?
What could she mean by it?
Here is the way we put in the time.
That would be very good.
Think of him.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Say no more about it.
Show me the way.
Where are you off to?
This for me?
Play with them.
Too much in the way.
Where are you from?
At your house?
What do they want?
Are you back again?
What do you think of that?
