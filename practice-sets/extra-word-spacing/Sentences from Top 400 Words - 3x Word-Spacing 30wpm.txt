He had enough of it.
Have you a family?
Who was it told me his name?
We call it black.
It is a rock.
He is better than any of you.
It will interest you, said he.
What have you heard?
That is true.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
We dont know enough.
Did you tell him your whole story?
How did this happen?
So do you, my love.
Let me remember what he said.
Then you will know me better.
He never told us what it was she said.
You may leave the room.
In an hour it will be at the door.
She had very little notice from him.
Have you told her?
And why do you serve?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
How could that happen?
You have your whole life before you, she said.
Are you all ready?
Do you own a dog?
You are better than that.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
He never heard.
You are in love with me?
She told me all about it.
The family was at home.
Where he was, no one knew.
Much of it was true.
In an hour?
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Read them, said the King.
This was true.
She was a good girl.
The night was cold.
We got her half way.
Better late than never.
No more money?
Let us leave them, she said.
But listen to this, he said.
Has she any family?
Take notice.
Feel better then.
Leave any for him?
You were told.
Let us talk about you.
I have no children to love me.
Listen to this, will you?
Ask them to sing one more song.
She is fast?
When did this happen?
Let this man pass.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
They knew it.
You had better go.
She must be told.
Was he young or old?
Is it true?
Why do you serve?
Now listen to me.
But one day you must feel it.
And you are still so young.
He got it this morning.
Never heard of it before.
From then on it was war between them.
Look to the west.
You are a good girl.
Against what side?
How does it feel?
Did they ever go back?
She is much better.
How do you feel now?
Pull it more to your side.
Does she go fast?
Are you better?
What can happen?
You will soon know.
It was all she could do to hold in.
When do you leave?
Fire and water, earth and air.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Why do we love?
And so they began to talk.
It was cold.
Young man, you will go far.
Little girl, where have you been?
You may go, said the King.
It has been there ever since.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
That is very simple.
You saw the person?
He has money.
That must be true.
Do you remember him?
A better man than you.
What have you against me now?
He put his hand over part of the map.
Have you heard?
But he never heard me.
Are they made to order?
We were up early.
That was the rule, she said.
And how did he make his money?
But enough of this.
Light my fire.
How many children did he leave?
You will always love him?
We are ready.
who told you you could?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
It is the rule.
You remember the place, my father?
They left in the morning.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
But how simple it is.
Which king?
What is love?
So we came down this road.
Can you sing?
Did he though?
Let me see him, said the young man.
And you will always love him?
Hold her hand.
Had you heard?
Leave off that.
Had they been heard?
The rock was very small.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
What do you mean by that question?
And serve them right.
You know me well enough.
Is the wind north or south?
The night was cold and still.
You are right, young man.
Can it be true?
Did you get any money?
It was true to life.
A house is on fire?
How far from the body?
We knew them both.
And what does she want the money for?
We serve them.
Are you ready?
They can have all our half of the house.
The King Went to him.
How do you feel?
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
But listen to me.
Do you love her much?
How does this happen?
This money was for her.
you must step out.
It is a fire.
And will you direct us?
We took our leave early, and left together.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Are you ready to play?
This will pass in no time.
We must make the best of it.
So the question was, what to do?
She is the first person in this house.
Where did they get the money from?
Answer me this one question.
You are on a ship?
Take good care of the little girl.
Who told you so?
How soon will he be here?
Better cross here.
Leave me out of the question.
This is simple.
And then he told all he knew.
But what did we ever get for it?
Your true father?
She knew what was good for children.
Keep in step.
Never heard of it.
How short his time.
what could be better?
What a state he was in.
Then get ready at once.
It was a round table.
That was the question.
Have you heard from him often?
Are you in love with her?
On fire, on fire.
The world is big enough.
That would be the best way.
That is enough.
An example would be better.
you should know her better than me.
He said, the work is now complete.
One other question, said he.
It is true.
And that is the whole point.
Who told you that?
And you can sing?
Let us talk a little about my father.
Try it on the dog first.
This is my body.
About the usual time.
Put down three and carry five.
Listen to them, he said.
You can pass through the door.
You are cold.
He is very simple.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
That is enough for me.
Do you love me?
Made me feel so young.
We had better go in.
Ten will be early enough.
Pull together.
You love him?
The dog is always with him.
Do you know that old lay?
Pass this way, then.
No, he is a man about my size.
They had much to talk about.
Is your man white or black?
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
No, my love.
Half as many is too much.
We had a list.
He knew them.
Then what would happen?
Are you here on leave?
If you only knew.
Better write it here.
Well, young man?
Take a hold of it.
She told me to ask you.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Are you still cold?
You must travel.
And so they knew that it was true.
He will leave me.
What does he feel?
Let me hear from you soon.
She knew at once.
It can never happen.
To know her is to love her.
What kind of a bird?
Now, listen.
Why talk to me?
Never heard of him.
What is there to talk about?
Do you remember me?
Can she sing?
She was so young, too.
Ten, did you say?
They had heard all that before.
They had several children.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Is your family well?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
You have an hour.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
A young man?
She is very plain.
you know better than that.
Let me also ask you a question.
Long live the king.
Well, are you ready?
It was true.
He said, get him out of the road.
Five young children.
But why must you leave me so soon?
Are we ready?
It is cold.
They told me to.
But she is very young.
Do you remember?
It would have been more simple.
They are still young.
She was only a little girl.
Half a mile?
Hold it up to the light.
They all heard me.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
You must leave that to me.
There are four hundred?
Will you answer that question?
Where are you off to so early?
Listen to me.
Let that pass.
We will talk about that.
Does he love you?
Your watch is slow.
And dont talk to me.
Why do they want to make her sing?
You are right, my love.
Let us pass.
No less, no more.
Do you want any money?
What a question.
As soon as you left, it began.
Why did it happen?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
If you know it, that is enough.
In short, take me.
Long and the short of it.
That may be true.
Remember that time?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
He had my love.
Is that true?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
What will happen to us?
What size do you want?
Listen to him.
Before you leave, tell us.
But let that pass.
There was no wind.
Every word you said was heard.
It is a young girl.
What will happen now?
It would be better if you went to the war.
An hour and a half.
