Never mind me.
Yes, she said.
It has to be done.
Yes, said the old man.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
It was a record run.
And yet you are the better off?
Yes, and no.
Well then, be quick.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
It stood behind the door.
Go and rest.
Bring them here.
Very well, wait a minute.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Oh, just listen.
It was a dark night.
Wait a minute.
Well, what does that lead up to?
A fine thing too.
Yes, but only for you and me.
What have they done with my work?
Perhaps he did.
Wonder is it like that.
The night was dark.
Decide if you are going back home.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Money is power.
Stay where you are.
Let me see your plan.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Let us sit down.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Where can you wait for me?
Just go to sleep.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Yes, go on.
It is nothing.
Oh, but you were there?
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Oh, dont ask me.
But she is nothing to me now.
What is done is done.
Try to sleep.
It is his voice.
You must have a rest.
Now we must wait.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Answer me that, miss.
Then lead the way.
Is that a fact?
He began to laugh.
Do you have my note?
That was well done.
What a game.
He knew nothing.
It was very dark.
And here is the note.
And then the game began all over again.
It must be done.
Nothing had come of it.
And yet you said he had money.
Of course it might.
Yes, very well.
Oh, take me with you.
Wonder what he does.
Oh, you are there.
Dont laugh.
Oh let me in.
That is a fact.
It was brought to me.
The water ran dry.
Yes, there it is.
Do you see that island?
How was it done?
Behind every book is a man.
It is possible.
Is that possible?
You brought no one with you?
All right then, sit down.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
At his side was a large green box.
Come, and we can rest together.
Oh, tell me.
But it must be done soon.
We brought them in.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Keep clear of him.
But they could see nothing.
Yes, what is it?
Well, there he stood.
Laugh, if you will.
It is all done.
It is no use, said a voice.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Oh, of course.
Wait a second.
Nothing at all.
There is a lot of people.
Yes, he said.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Of course it is.
My mind was soon made up.
Go back to bed.
He is among us.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Did she stay long?
Let him go free?
Then he must be a wonder.
What have you done?
Yes, he did.
The whole day had been hot.
He had, to be sure, done much.
is it come yet?
Look at that dark water.
He had made up his mind.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Money is no object?
He ran up to them.
and so he decide he go back home.
You love a certain person.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Never mind how he came here.
Bring it here.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Of course she will.
Wait for me.
Oh, do as you like.
Get to bed.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Yes, but what did she say?
How long ago?
Yes, that is true.
Did she fall?
He gave me this paper.
And sit in the dark?
He has a good voice still.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Yes, you are right.
Yes, go and find out.
They need a rest.
There is nothing more to be said.
Then bring them to me, she said.
They would cry.
Nothing new under the sun.
That is possible.
The city was soon behind me.
He must wait.
Why, of course.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Here is our plan.
Hold on a minute.
It is time for bed.
Clear the table.
They all fall to the ground.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
His first cry was for his father.
Nothing could be more simple.
Wait and see.
Why did you bring him here?
You will fall.
It was full of people.
It is done.
And what a voice she has.
Yes, it is true.
He was here a minute ago.
It was cold and dark.
Oh, no.
Oh, go on.
Who brought you up?
Well, but where can he fly to?
Will you rest here a little?
But that is nothing to us.
If only they would be quick.
What age is he?
Of course he was right.
Yes, to be sure.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Yes and no.
Fine, very fine.
She heard and saw nothing.
What has he done?
Yes, all right.
All that for nothing?
How is that done?
Oh, man.
They call him a fine boy.
She was still game.
Clear my name.
Go in there and drive them out.
She gave me her hand.
This made him wonder more and more.
Oh, nothing.
She got her hand free.
Are you strong?
The old man gave no answer.
Then it is certain?
But how long ago?
We are more strong together.
The island was a mile long.
What kind of voice is it?
Why does the boat go so fast?
It is certain.
Yes, she could sing that.
What have they done?
Is it possible?
But let us see your plan.
He will sleep an hour.
It was right in front of us.
Quick, friend, quick.
People might know my voice and find me out.
He must be in the same boat as us.
His plan is very simple.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
What can be done?
See what you have done.
Behind my bed.
Oh, he is so kind.
That would be a fine thing.
It was a warm night.
He stood up.
Yes, it did.
All of this was possible.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Then all was dark again.
And he told you nothing?
Leave the rest to me.
Oh, take those off.
It was a cold, dark night.
Fly, my friend.
Yes, we know that.
The snow is deep.
It might have done me good.
Play the game out.
It is very clear.
You can hear that, miss?
What brought you here?
Oh, do the best you can.
Sit down, he said.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
What did the letter contain?
You must stay.
Well, what about my plan?
Did it all rest on me?
You can sleep here.
Can it be possible?
Like these in shape and size?
This voice was that of my father.
It is a real bed.
You knew it, and said nothing?
Are they on foot?
Yes, my love?
No, nothing of the kind.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
It was done.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Oh, to be sure.
Help me sit up.
Just let us go free.
It was so long ago.
Oh, that.
Sit down, said the old man.
He never said nothing.
Come quick.
In a minute.
Well yes, you are right.
We must be quick.
Who gave it to you?
He is in the box.
But what then must be done?
What is power?
The night was very dark.
What more is to be done?
No, nothing at all.
It was so very long ago.
Well, of course.
Well, sit down.
Better sit still.
In that town there is a street.
They know nothing about it.
And you can do nothing until then?
Good to rest once in a way.
Nothing could have been better.
Of course they will.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
There is your old bed.
Well, miss?
Half the town was there.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
How was that possible?
Your voice is that of a young man.
Wonder if he has a name.
Clear the way.
Oh, that is very simple.
You better stay here all night.
There was more to be done.
You are free to do so.
Is he in bed?
Yes, she was back.
His will be done.
He left long ago.
All was dark.
You know you must say yes.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Let her wait.
It must be done at once.
Oh, all right.
Yes, sit down.
How can a little dog laugh?
Bring this with you.
Yes, once.
Oh, come now.
The whole night the tree stood still.
I hear his voice in the house.
Did he fall?
Again came the voice.
It was a very dark night.
Which box do you mean?
Take good note of it.
My mind is made up.
We are free to act and think.
Never mind that.
But wait a minute.
Yes, of course.
This is a test.
Oh, very well, he said.
It was hot.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Oh, if men only knew.
He saw nothing.
Why should my father fly?
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
There is no possible way.
Oh, do you know?
But never mind that.
In her name, then, let it be done.
You must stay with me.
What has brought you here?
She began to cry.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Free to do what?
She could think of nothing more to say.
Oh, this is too much.
But what must be done?
Lead me to him.
Is it certain?
How long would you keep me in town?
Is my father in town?
There, by the wheel.
You are in my power.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Well, sit down by me.
Nothing she can eat?
Her voice was low.
It was a kind of language between us.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
And what have you done to me?
Nothing is more simple.
Be back in a minute.
You know nothing about it.
