Turn this way.
take them all.
Who is that man?
Think what you will.
And where was the place?
How old was she?
Why did he come?
You must take me with you.
What is in your hand?
Why is he here?
And how old were you at that time?
You must come now.
Are you here for good?
She was right.
And where is she, then?
All right, then.
That is the end of her.
Show me the way he went.
Do you know me?
Where are we?
Good day, one and all.
And what did he say?
Where have they been?
Well, and is that all?
There she is again.
Then they will follow you?
What have you been after?
Well, did he?
But where is it?
Can you help me find my way?
Why, what is it, then?
And how in the world did you find them?
How can you say that?
How much are they?
Is that right?
Do you think she was?
What does one live for?
Three, he said.
Show us where you live, said the man.
Too much in the way.
No, mother.
Where are you?
What on earth does this mean?
They had all been very good to us.
Good day to you.
Where did you place it?
What do you think of her?
Say what you want.
where did she come from?
What do you think of this?
Say no more about it.
For some man.
That was a house to look at.
Why do you want water?
Well, what do you think about it?
Are you at it again?
Come and help me.
Do you think so?
Where is she?
What did he say?
How old are you?
What does all this mean?
Hand it in.
Read that, he said.
Show me the way.
And where is this man?
And what about your mother?
But it is just so with the world.
What is his name?
And a very good thing, too.
You can help me here.
It is all the same.
Give me my work.
Where are you from?
But you must.
When will it take place?
Would you now like to look round my place?
It is very high.
Think of him.
What do they want?
There was work to do.
Why are you like this?
This is my point.
He will live.
See, they are here.
Tell me all about it.
Here is the way we put in the time.
And what are they made of?
this one, too?
Is it as good now?
And how did you find out?
Just like me.
Why, what do you mean?
What a good thing it would be.
Come with me to the little house.
Will you come with me?
Here it is.
But this is the point.
Tell me about it.
Well, here he is.
Is he a good man?
How on earth do you know?
It would be very kind of you.
How could she say such a thing.
Follow me, said the man.
It is the same thing.
Look at me.
Where does he live?
Now, what do you want with me?
What do they say was the cause?
There is no place like home.
There is the little boy.
But where are we to go?
He is at my house.
Look at it other way round.
Well, how did it go?
Where in the world did you come from?
What does it all mean?
Well then, tell him so.
How do you take it?
What did he tell you?
She has a house?
This is the first act.
Take some, she said.
Ask him to show up?
Well then, what do you want?
This is the man.
Where is he now?
It must be where you put it.
Why are you here?
And that was the end of it.
Well, all right.
You can say what it is.
there are only two.
And in she went.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
How can you find out?
She has been with him many long years.
Now come here.
It is very kind of you.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Do you think so now?
This for me?
And who is the man?
Well, tell me.
Will you take me to her?
Get to work.
What was his name?
What do you mean by that?
Much good that would be.
What could set you off in the first place?
How can you think of such a thing?
Give it me.
Is he big?
But what did you want?
Tell us all about it.
There is no one here to see.
There will just be time.
Why do you want to know?
Tell me his name.
Is that all you want?
They want more.
Now where did they come from?
What will you say?
But he is right.
Read that, she said.
You were near him.
Think it over.
Now, you know me.
What do you play?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
What do you mean?
And they went home.
To what end?
There is more to tell.
Well, and what do you think?
do you come from the end of the world?
But where is he?
Such as what?
How much do you want?
Now, go home.
Is this the man?
Here she is.
But why do you ask?
You must tell me.
That is right.
That was a good time.
Here is my hand.
Say no more.
What you have just said is good, very good.
But what about me?
And it did me good.
Were you here before me?
Large or small?
Have you been here long?
Give him air.
What do you want me to do?
What could she mean by it?
Think no more about that.
It is great.
That is just my point.
Is she well?
Too much of this.
No, tell me.
And what is her name?
How long have you been here?
How does she use you?
After three, he said.
Where are you off to?
Who are these men?
Is there no one who can help me?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Where do they get that?
What is your name?
Put it on.
There was no one near.
She was the cause of it all.
Time to get out.
You are most kind.
She went on.
What is that in your hand?
And why is that?
What do you think of him?
Well, read it.
Well, how are you?
What does she think about me?
Did you tell him?
Only two there now.
Then why are you here?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
That would be very good.
Where are we to turn for help?
It will take a little time.
What more could a man ask for?
And where is it?
Move on, then.
What will each of you give?
Some day you may ask me about it.
Where to, now?
What on earth do you mean?
Do it for me.
You think so, too?
What do you want to ask these people?
And what will they do with us?
Is there some for me?
Very well then.
You are all very kind to me.
And what was his name?
What does he mean?
They are here.
In what year?
You think so?
Can you point it out to me?
Try it on.
Give me more than that
Give it to me, then.
Here it is, he said.
Get out of the way.
Do you want me to do it?
He was so kind.
But what does it mean?
But who was your mother?
Go and try.
Well, what do you think?
She came up to them.
When will he come back?
Who will tell her?
And what do you think?
She had to tell him.
I would like to see her again in that.
Where did he come from?
If you want to know, go and find out.
But he does so need a mother.
We are here.
See, here it is.
We are who we say we are.
How does he use it?
Very well, show him to me.
Where are they off to now?
Is it large?
How did you get me out?
You will get on in the world.
Is it you or me?
Where have you been?
He went on his way.
Ask her, he said.
Give me a light.
How did you get here?
Can you take me?
Where is he?
Tell me who made the world.
One, two, three.
All in good time.
There, that does me good.
Then will come our time.
Then what kind is it?
The world is before you.
And do you know why?
He said that that would help.
What was it you said to me?
And off we go.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
What do you think of that?
Why are they here?
He went to him.
You are a good boy.
Why is that?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Is it all right?
He was there too.
Just look through it.
What did you say your name was?
We must come back.
Well, go on.
What do you want?
He said too much.
Take this and this.
Good, he said.
Now it was time to act.
And have you been here long?
Been back long?
Will you try?
Tell us your name.
How did that help you?
He was here.
Come with me, then.
That was very good.
When will her mother come?
The first act was over.
Which house is it?
Get out and play.
Come with me.
Now tell me.
What does she want?
We will say no more about it, then.
What would you have me do?
But why do you ask me?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Where could he be?
Call me what you will, he said.
Where do you live?
You see it every day.
For how much?
Give me your hand.
He will ask for it.
You know, you see right through people.
And where is he now?
Play with them.
He has more to give.
You are right.
Just look at her.
And what did she say?
At your house?
Very well, he said.
That is right, said the old man.
Are they like each other?
How can you tell?
Now we see the light.
It was high time.
Show it to me.
What did you say that for?
He was at work again.
In what part of the house?
Is it any good?
Too much for me now.
That is all one can say about her.
Are you back again?
