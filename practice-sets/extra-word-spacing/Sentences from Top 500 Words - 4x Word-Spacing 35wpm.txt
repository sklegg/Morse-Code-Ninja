Get to bed.
Half the town was there.
Oh, that.
Stay where you are.
It was a record run.
Laugh, if you will.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Yes, he said.
But let us see your plan.
Like these in shape and size?
What has he done?
His plan is very simple.
Wonder is it like that.
What is power?
Where can you wait for me?
Yes, my love?
and so he decide he go back home.
It must be done.
Yes, and no.
Wait and see.
Go and rest.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
What have they done?
What age is he?
She could think of nothing more to say.
Bring this with you.
He must wait.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Oh, you are there.
Of course he was right.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Oh, very well, he said.
And here is the note.
Well, what about my plan?
All that for nothing?
It was a cold, dark night.
And sit in the dark?
What more is to be done?
Nothing had come of it.
How long would you keep me in town?
Of course they will.
It is done.
Yes, that is true.
Oh, to be sure.
But never mind that.
Come, and we can rest together.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
They would cry.
Go back to bed.
Just go to sleep.
And then the game began all over again.
And yet you are the better off?
Yes, but only for you and me.
Nothing she can eat?
Is it certain?
What a game.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Clear the way.
And you can do nothing until then?
Is my father in town?
Nothing could be more simple.
Help me sit up.
You better stay here all night.
You brought no one with you?
It might have done me good.
He is in the box.
How was that possible?
All of this was possible.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Yes, she said.
Yes, but what did she say?
What have they done with my work?
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Wait a second.
Oh, do the best you can.
All right then, sit down.
Free to do what?
Of course it is.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Be back in a minute.
Now we must wait.
Oh, if men only knew.
It was very dark.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
She got her hand free.
She began to cry.
Nothing could have been better.
Again came the voice.
Is he in bed?
Nothing at all.
Of course she will.
That is possible.
Yes, we know that.
Yes, he did.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Well, sit down.
But what then must be done?
The whole day had been hot.
He had made up his mind.
Sit down, said the old man.
Yes, she could sing that.
Very well, wait a minute.
That was well done.
Yes, there it is.
He knew nothing.
Oh, that is very simple.
Yes, said the old man.
What has brought you here?
But wait a minute.
We are free to act and think.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Wonder what he does.
He left long ago.
The night was very dark.
Answer me that, miss.
Well, sit down by me.
He ran up to them.
It must be done at once.
Lead me to him.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Oh, he is so kind.
Yes, sit down.
No, nothing of the kind.
Yes, all right.
Are they on foot?
But they could see nothing.
Did she fall?
Then he must be a wonder.
You know you must say yes.
There is nothing more to be said.
Do you see that island?
I hear his voice in the house.
You must stay with me.
What have you done?
There was more to be done.
Just let us go free.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Look at that dark water.
We must be quick.
See what you have done.
Yes, to be sure.
He must be in the same boat as us.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
She gave me her hand.
Yes, it is true.
There, by the wheel.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
If only they would be quick.
The city was soon behind me.
Keep clear of him.
They need a rest.
Oh, do as you like.
At his side was a large green box.
Nothing new under the sun.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
He will sleep an hour.
Nothing is more simple.
Oh, no.
It was right in front of us.
Decide if you are going back home.
My mind was soon made up.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
How is that done?
Never mind that.
Oh, just listen.
It is all done.
Oh, nothing.
She heard and saw nothing.
Fine, very fine.
Oh, dont ask me.
Let us sit down.
Perhaps he did.
How can a little dog laugh?
Oh, do you know?
Better sit still.
Let me see your plan.
Sit down, he said.
Try to sleep.
Of course it might.
Well, of course.
What can be done?
Oh, take me with you.
And yet you said he had money.
Clear the table.
What kind of voice is it?
Fly, my friend.
Yes, of course.
It is his voice.
It is possible.
Yes, very well.
Let her wait.
This voice was that of my father.
Can it be possible?
Yes, you are right.
But how long ago?
His will be done.
They all fall to the ground.
Did it all rest on me?
You must have a rest.
Hold on a minute.
They know nothing about it.
Wait for me.
No, nothing at all.
That is a fact.
Never mind me.
Never mind how he came here.
There is no possible way.
His first cry was for his father.
You know nothing about it.
He began to laugh.
The night was dark.
Money is power.
He had, to be sure, done much.
He saw nothing.
Oh, of course.
Oh, come now.
She was still game.
Yes and no.
Yes, she was back.
Money is no object?
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
He never said nothing.
Yes, once.
You are free to do so.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Behind every book is a man.
The island was a mile long.
Well, there he stood.
Take good note of it.
Will you rest here a little?
It is very clear.
It is no use, said a voice.
Oh, but you were there?
It is a real bed.
Yes, he said, all of it.
It was a kind of language between us.
Did he fall?
You can sleep here.
Yes, what is it?
Well yes, you are right.
But that is nothing to us.
In her name, then, let it be done.
But it must be done soon.
You could see there was a story behind it.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Which box do you mean?
This made him wonder more and more.
It has to be done.
Is it possible?
Then it is certain?
The whole night the tree stood still.
Is that possible?
It was cold and dark.
He has a good voice still.
Well, miss?
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
It was hot.
You love a certain person.
Why did you bring him here?
It was a dark night.
Wait a minute.
How long ago?
The old man gave no answer.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Oh, go on.
What brought you here?
In that town there is a street.
A fine thing too.
He gave me this paper.
Let him go free?
Your voice is that of a young man.
Oh let me in.
He was here a minute ago.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Oh, man.
You knew it, and said nothing?
In a minute.
And he told you nothing?
Oh, take those off.
Oh, all right.
Do you talk in your sleep?
We brought them in.
But what must be done?
People might know my voice and find me out.
Why should my father fly?
And what have you done to me?
Did she stay long?
It was a warm night.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Yes, go and find out.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
There is your old bed.
Behind my bed.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Why, of course.
Dont laugh.
Well then, be quick.
It was done.
Are you strong?
The water ran dry.
It was so very long ago.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Quick, friend, quick.
It was brought to me.
It is nothing.
Who brought you up?
Clear my name.
Do you have my note?
My mind is made up.
What is done is done.
They call him a fine boy.
Good to rest once in a way.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
is it come yet?
That would be a fine thing.
It is certain.
Play the game out.
There is a lot of people.
It is time for bed.
Here is our plan.
It was so long ago.
It stood behind the door.
The snow is deep.
But she is nothing to me now.
Then lead the way.
All was dark.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
And what a voice she has.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Bring them here.
There is no one in that room behind you.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
You will fall.
Yes, that was a picture book.
You can hear that, miss?
Well, but where can he fly to?
Yes, go on.
Oh, tell me.
Be quick, for the time is short.
He stood up.
Who gave it to you?
You are in my power.
It was full of people.
What did the letter contain?
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Leave the rest to me.
It was a very dark night.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Wonder if he has a name.
Come quick.
Yes, it did.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Oh, this is too much.
Go in there and drive them out.
Bring it here.
Her voice was low.
You must stay.
Is that a fact?
We are more strong together.
He is among us.
How was it done?
The little boy lay in his bed.
This is a test.
Then all was dark again.
