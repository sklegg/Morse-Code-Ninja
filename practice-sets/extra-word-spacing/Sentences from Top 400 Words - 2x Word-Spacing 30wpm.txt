Me to the North, and you to the South.
What size do you want?
It was cold.
How many children did he leave?
You will always love him?
Are you better?
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
No, he is a man about my size.
Ask them to sing one more song.
It is true.
Answer me this one question.
How could that happen?
Take a hold of it.
Pull together.
We will talk about that.
And dont talk to me.
You know me well enough.
How short his time.
That is very simple.
He had my love.
Do you love her much?
That is true.
And serve them right.
He has money.
What a state he was in.
Then get ready at once.
Why do you serve?
That is enough.
An example would be better.
He said, get him out of the road.
You are cold.
And you can sing?
You must leave that to me.
It would be better if you went to the war.
She is very plain.
It was a round table.
Did you get any money?
Five young children.
They had several children.
And then he told all he knew.
Let that pass.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
You remember the place, my father?
But he never heard me.
It would have been more simple.
Have you told her?
It is the rule.
How does it feel?
On fire, on fire.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Let us talk about you.
Now, listen.
We must make the best of it.
Where he was, no one knew.
Keep in step.
Well, are you ready?
An hour and a half.
Your watch is slow.
But let that pass.
Are they made to order?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
She told me all about it.
Does he love you?
Pull it more to your side.
As soon as you left, it began.
They told me to.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
You are a good girl.
You are right, my love.
She had very little notice from him.
How did this happen?
They had heard all that before.
But she is very young.
She is much better.
The night was cold.
To know her is to love her.
No more money?
And you are still so young.
It was true.
Made me feel so young.
Do you own a dog?
Did they ever go back?
Feel better then.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Never heard of it before.
The rock was very small.
It has been there ever since.
Do you remember me?
Put down three and carry five.
We were up early.
Had you heard?
We knew them both.
When do you leave?
She is the first person in this house.
He is better than any of you.
You are on a ship?
That was the question.
Listen to this, will you?
Better late than never.
They had much to talk about.
Have you a family?
How do you feel now?
That may be true.
Why do we love?
Never heard of him.
This money was for her.
Who told you so?
You may leave the room.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
But why must you leave me so soon?
Little girl, where have you been?
Every word you said was heard.
But one day you must feel it.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Ten, did you say?
Can she sing?
Leave any for him?
They left in the morning.
There are four hundred?
It was all she could do to hold in.
Who was it told me his name?
you know better than that.
You love him?
Who told you that?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
It can never happen.
If you know it, that is enough.
Let me also ask you a question.
I have no children to love me.
Half a mile?
What have you heard?
Now listen to me.
Can you sing?
So the question was, what to do?
Has she any family?
What do you mean by that question?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
She told me to ask you.
This is simple.
The night was cold and still.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
You are better than that.
You may go, said the King.
Light my fire.
And what does she want the money for?
Is that true?
Remember that time?
She is fast?
Do you love me?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
The family was at home.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Leave off that.
Where are you off to so early?
It is a rock.
Let us talk a little about my father.
And how did he make his money?
What will happen now?
Let me hear from you soon.
He never heard.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Are you ready to play?
Do you remember?
He put his hand over part of the map.
you must step out.
She was only a little girl.
And so they knew that it was true.
No, my love.
Better cross here.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
Is the wind north or south?
Why talk to me?
How do you feel?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
If you only knew.
Hold it up to the light.
Is your family well?
Fire and water, earth and air.
You are in love with me?
A house is on fire?
Better write it here.
He got it this morning.
What will happen to us?
Is your man white or black?
And that is the whole point.
Your true father?
We got her half way.
What kind of a bird?
From then on it was war between them.
Let me see him, said the young man.
You will soon know.
And you will always love him?
Had they been heard?
Have you heard from him often?
In short, take me.
Did he though?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
And will you direct us?
They knew it.
They all heard me.
But what did we ever get for it?
Before you leave, tell us.
But listen to me.
She knew what was good for children.
We had a list.
We dont know enough.
Take good care of the little girl.
You must travel.
Read them, said the King.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Did you tell him your whole story?
It is a fire.
Leave me out of the question.
What have you against me now?
But listen to this, he said.
Do you remember him?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
A better man than you.
One other question, said he.
Do you know that old lay?
It was true to life.
Which king?
Much of it was true.
But how simple it is.
Let this man pass.
A young man?
She was so young, too.
Let us leave them, she said.
Half as many is too much.
You are right, young man.
He is very simple.
Let us pass.
So do you, my love.
What does he feel?
Try it on the dog first.
Let me remember what he said.
It is a young girl.
He never told us what it was she said.
Does she go fast?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
We had better go in.
Are you in love with her?
Hold her hand.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Young man, you will go far.
Then you will know me better.
Can it be true?
It will interest you, said he.
They are still young.
We call it black.
He will leave me.
who told you you could?
Why did it happen?
Do you want any money?
Listen to him.
About the usual time.
He had enough of it.
He knew them.
He said, the work is now complete.
But enough of this.
What can happen?
Will you answer that question?
You saw the person?
Listen to me.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
How soon will he be here?
Are we ready?
It is cold.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Then what would happen?
Was he young or old?
you should know her better than me.
What is there to talk about?
The dog is always with him.
In an hour?
Take notice.
Against what side?
You were told.
That must be true.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
How far from the body?
What is love?
Listen to them, he said.
Never heard of it.
When did this happen?
And so they began to talk.
We serve them.
She must be told.
That would be the best way.
She was a good girl.
She knew at once.
This is my body.
That is enough for me.
Pass this way, then.
You had better go.
Long live the king.
Why do they want to make her sing?
Long and the short of it.
There was no wind.
Where did they get the money from?
And why do you serve?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
what could be better?
Are you all ready?
That was the rule, she said.
Well, young man?
The King Went to him.
Have you heard?
No less, no more.
Is it true?
This will pass in no time.
The world is big enough.
What a question.
How does this happen?
You have an hour.
This was true.
Are you still cold?
They can have all our half of the house.
Look to the west.
Are you here on leave?
Ten will be early enough.
We are ready.
Are you ready?
You can pass through the door.
So we came down this road.
