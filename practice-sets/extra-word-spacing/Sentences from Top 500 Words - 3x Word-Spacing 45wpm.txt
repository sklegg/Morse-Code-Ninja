Nothing she can eat?
He is in the box.
Wait a second.
What is power?
Did it all rest on me?
The old man gave no answer.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Come, let me show you my plan.
She heard and saw nothing.
A fine thing too.
That is possible.
Come quick.
Never mind that.
She gave me her hand.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Oh, all right.
Well, miss?
Oh, to be sure.
Yes, to be sure.
Oh, nothing.
Can it be possible?
Sit down, said the old man.
Yes, you are right.
But that is nothing to us.
Then he must be a wonder.
The city was soon behind me.
Oh, tell me.
Yes, go and find out.
Oh, that.
He must wait.
Nothing new under the sun.
Yes, she could sing that.
Half the town was there.
What more is to be done?
You can hear that, miss?
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Very well, wait a minute.
All that for nothing?
Oh, very well, he said.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Decide if you are going back home.
What is done is done.
Oh, but you were there?
Never mind me.
There is a lot of people.
Oh, do as you like.
Help me sit up.
Bring them here.
Well yes, you are right.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Of course he was right.
Bring it here.
It was so very long ago.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Oh, dont ask me.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
But she is nothing to me now.
He saw nothing.
Lead me to him.
Are they on foot?
There is no one in that room behind you.
But let us see your plan.
Well, of course.
Did she fall?
You love a certain person.
Perhaps he did.
Try to sleep.
You brought no one with you?
He stood up.
The night was very dark.
This made him wonder more and more.
Do you have my note?
It is done.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Oh, no.
You can sleep here.
My mind is made up.
That was well done.
Like these in shape and size?
Are you strong?
Yes, we know that.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Sit down, he said.
Yes, she was back.
Go in there and drive them out.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
There was more to be done.
Oh, take me with you.
Oh, do the best you can.
What did the letter contain?
What has he done?
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Oh, of course.
Good to rest once in a way.
Wonder if he has a name.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Oh, come now.
Who brought you up?
And yet you said he had money.
In that town there is a street.
They need a rest.
We brought them in.
Behind every book is a man.
It is time for bed.
Keep clear of him.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Of course it is.
What have you done?
And what have you done to me?
He had made up his mind.
And he told you nothing?
In a minute.
Nothing could be more simple.
He knew nothing.
It has to be done.
Yes, that is true.
You better stay here all night.
She began to cry.
How was that possible?
Yes, he did.
Wait a minute.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Yes, said the old man.
His will be done.
Let us sit down.
Money is power.
Then all was dark again.
It was brought to me.
It was hot.
But how long ago?
He must be in the same boat as us.
That is a fact.
All was dark.
It is very clear.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Oh, you are there.
Yes, and no.
Is my father in town?
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
How can a little dog laugh?
There, by the wheel.
Yes, sit down.
Yes, what is it?
You knew it, and said nothing?
Yes, it did.
Yes and no.
And here is the note.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Dont laugh.
Leave the rest to me.
How long would you keep me in town?
Yes, my love?
We are free to act and think.
Laugh, if you will.
Let her wait.
Bring this with you.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Then it is certain?
At his side was a large green box.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
And yet you are the better off?
Look at that dark water.
Stay where you are.
is it come yet?
Do you see that island?
They call him a fine boy.
Let me see your plan.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
If only they would be quick.
Well then, be quick.
What can be done?
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
You are free to do so.
Did she stay long?
It was very dark.
Yes, she said.
It is his voice.
He has a good voice still.
It was full of people.
Yes, all right.
Just let us go free.
But never mind that.
Money is no object?
The snow is deep.
In her name, then, let it be done.
The whole day had been hot.
You will fall.
Oh let me in.
But wait a minute.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Oh, he is so kind.
Go back to bed.
Is it certain?
There is no possible way.
What a game.
Of course she will.
Well, but where can he fly to?
What have they done?
The water ran dry.
It stood behind the door.
Go and rest.
We must be quick.
Her voice was low.
Be back in a minute.
Is it possible?
Will you rest here a little?
Your voice is that of a young man.
Nothing is more simple.
It was a dark night.
It was a cold, dark night.
Clear the way.
Clear my name.
It might have done me good.
Yes, it is true.
You must have a rest.
And what a voice she has.
Come, and we can rest together.
There is your old bed.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
His plan is very simple.
Nothing had come of it.
Oh, do you know?
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Behind my bed.
Where can you wait for me?
Oh, if men only knew.
Oh, that is very simple.
And then the game began all over again.
You must stay with me.
His first cry was for his father.
My mind was soon made up.
Well, there he stood.
He is among us.
Why, of course.
He ran up to them.
But they could see nothing.
And sit in the dark?
and so he decide he go back home.
The island was a mile long.
Is that possible?
It is certain.
Again came the voice.
What have they done with my work?
Clear the table.
He left long ago.
They all fall to the ground.
It was a warm night.
Is that a fact?
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Well, sit down by me.
And you can do nothing until then?
Fly, my friend.
No, nothing of the kind.
Wonder what he does.
It was so long ago.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Play the game out.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
I hear his voice in the house.
Well, sit down.
It is possible.
Now we must wait.
What has brought you here?
What kind of voice is it?
Did he fall?
The little boy lay in his bed.
Answer me that, miss.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Yes, he said.
There is nothing more to be said.
Oh, man.
All right then, sit down.
See what you have done.
Wait for me.
You know nothing about it.
It was a kind of language between us.
He will sleep an hour.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
It is nothing.
Take good note of it.
Yes, very well.
This voice was that of my father.
The night was dark.
It is no use, said a voice.
You are in my power.
We are more strong together.
Get to bed.
He was here a minute ago.
Never mind how he came here.
Wonder is it like that.
What brought you here?
It must be done.
It was right in front of us.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Free to do what?
Oh, go on.
Wait and see.
He gave me this paper.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Of course they will.
Let him go free?
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Here is our plan.
This is a test.
What age is he?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
No, nothing at all.
Yes, once.
Yes, of course.
But it must be done soon.
Why did you bring him here?
Which box do you mean?
You know you must say yes.
Just go to sleep.
It was done.
It was cold and dark.
How long ago?
They know nothing about it.
But what then must be done?
Who gave it to you?
Better sit still.
Hold on a minute.
How was it done?
It must be done at once.
Oh, this is too much.
Nothing could have been better.
Then lead the way.
It was a record run.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
You must stay.
The whole night the tree stood still.
It is a real bed.
Nothing at all.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Fine, very fine.
Quick, friend, quick.
It was a very dark night.
Yes, there it is.
They would cry.
All of this was possible.
She got her hand free.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
But what must be done?
That would be a fine thing.
She was still game.
Of course it might.
He never said nothing.
You could see there was a story behind it.
He began to laugh.
Well, what about my plan?
Yes, but what did she say?
How is that done?
It is all done.
Is he in bed?
Why should my father fly?
Oh, just listen.
Yes, go on.
Oh, take those off.
