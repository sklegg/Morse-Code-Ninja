Then what kind is it?
And who is the man?
Why is he here?
But where is it?
What did you say that for?
Where are you from?
Look at it other way round.
Only two there now.
Where did you place it?
What does all this mean?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
That was a good time.
Where are we?
But why do you ask?
Just like me.
Why are you here?
Give him air.
Then why are you here?
Call me what you will, he said.
Come with me to the little house.
I would like to see her again in that.
That is all one can say about her.
Think no more about that.
Come with me.
What will you say?
There is more to tell.
There will just be time.
Where are we to turn for help?
And where is this man?
Time to get out.
And where was the place?
And what did he say?
What did he tell you?
Tell us your name.
Ask her, he said.
Do you think so now?
What could set you off in the first place?
What does it all mean?
You must take me with you.
Do it for me.
Much good that would be.
What do you think of this?
Where to, now?
Is he big?
Good, he said.
That was a house to look at.
See, here it is.
There is no place like home.
And have you been here long?
There was no one near.
Where are they off to now?
And where is he now?
Can you help me find my way?
But it is just so with the world.
How much are they?
Follow me, said the man.
You can help me here.
You are all very kind to me.
Turn this way.
This for me?
Get out and play.
He is at my house.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
How on earth do you know?
How old was she?
Well, go on.
Show me the way he went.
How can you think of such a thing?
What you have just said is good, very good.
One, two, three.
Well, how did it go?
Here is the way we put in the time.
You are right.
And how old were you at that time?
He was at work again.
But you must.
What is in your hand?
Go and try.
But what did you want?
And do you know why?
Say no more.
And what did she say?
After three, he said.
Say no more about it.
Been back long?
He said too much.
What do you think of her?
You think so?
What is that in your hand?
No, mother.
How does he use it?
What do they say was the cause?
What do they want?
How does she use you?
Give me your hand.
We are here.
She was the cause of it all.
There she is again.
Too much for me now.
Can you point it out to me?
What more could a man ask for?
Well then, tell him so.
Is this the man?
You see it every day.
When will it take place?
How old are you?
It is all the same.
But why do you ask me?
Well, tell me.
How can you find out?
Do you think so?
What do you want?
What did you say your name was?
Where is he now?
Well, and what do you think?
Then they will follow you?
He was here.
Have you been here long?
There is no one here to see.
This is my point.
What does she think about me?
But what does it mean?
Tell me his name.
What do you mean?
She was right.
You are most kind.
How did you get me out?
We are who we say we are.
Can you take me?
If you want to know, go and find out.
And where is she, then?
Where are you off to?
Would you now like to look round my place?
And what is her name?
You were near him.
You are a good boy.
Where have you been?
this one, too?
He went on his way.
Why is that?
Now we see the light.
Is there some for me?
You know, you see right through people.
What do you think of that?
Look at me.
What do you want me to do?
They had all been very good to us.
Who will tell her?
You will get on in the world.
See, they are here.
Are they like each other?
And they went home.
Well then, what do you want?
Here it is.
Where does he live?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
For how much?
What do you play?
Do you think she was?
What would you have me do?
Why do you want water?
there are only two.
Who is that man?
Is it any good?
Well, read it.
They want more.
Give it to me, then.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
There is the little boy.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Read that, he said.
Just look through it.
You can say what it is.
How can you tell?
You must come now.
Take some, she said.
Large or small?
He said that that would help.
Come and help me.
We must come back.
Do you want me to do it?
Show it to me.
That is just my point.
What was his name?
Give me a light.
And in she went.
Some day you may ask me about it.
Why, what is it, then?
Very well, he said.
Is that all you want?
Now, go home.
The first act was over.
It would be very kind of you.
Are you at it again?
Where do they get that?
He has more to give.
Why did he come?
How do you take it?
Now, what do you want with me?
When will he come back?
When will her mother come?
Here is my hand.
He was so kind.
Tell me about it.
It is the same thing.
We will say no more about it, then.
All right, then.
Where do you live?
Now come here.
What was it you said to me?
Read that, she said.
Well, did he?
What did he say?
That is right, said the old man.
Now it was time to act.
How could she say such a thing.
Well, here he is.
And off we go.
Why, what do you mean?
Are you back again?
And where is it?
But who was your mother?
Put it on.
How can you say that?
And what are they made of?
Then will come our time.
Tell us all about it.
Where is he?
Hand it in.
Now tell me.
Who are these men?
Now where did they come from?
Too much in the way.
What will each of you give?
Ask him to show up?
And it did me good.
Give it me.
Is it you or me?
That would be very good.
It was now his turn to look about him.
And how did you find out?
It must be where you put it.
Why are you like this?
All in good time.
What does she want?
She went on.
And how in the world did you find them?
Is she well?
Give me my work.
Why are they here?
And what about your mother?
Tell me all about it.
How did that help you?
Come with me, then.
Here it is, he said.
In what year?
But where are we to go?
But he is right.
What on earth does this mean?
Did you tell him?
What could she mean by it?
Well, what do you think about it?
What do you want to ask these people?
You think so, too?
To what end?
He will ask for it.
Is that right?
Play with them.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
It was high time.
What have you been after?
What is your name?
Where in the world did you come from?
Here she is.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Are you here for good?
Where could he be?
There, that does me good.
And that was the end of it.
Where is she?
Well, how are you?
Why do you want to know?
At your house?
Good day to you.
Is it all right?
Take this and this.
What does one live for?
Get out of the way.
That is right.
Now, you know me.
Say what you want.
It is very high.
How did you get here?
For some man.
And what do you think?
She had to tell him.
Where did he come from?
Is he a good man?
What on earth do you mean?
How much do you want?
Is there no one who can help me?
Tell me who made the world.
It is very kind of you.
This is the man.
Very well, show him to me.
That is the end of her.
Well, what do you think?
Give me more than that
Where are you?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Too much of this.
Is it large?
Think what you will.
You must tell me.
do you come from the end of the world?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Such as what?
where did she come from?
Which house is it?
What do you think of him?
She has been with him many long years.
Good day, one and all.
Will you come with me?
Try it on.
What do you mean by that?
Get to work.
What does he mean?
Where have they been?
Think of him.
Well, and is that all?
But this is the point.
What is his name?
She came up to them.
Do you know me?
Will you try?
Were you here before me?
And a very good thing, too.
No, tell me.
This is the first act.
He was there too.
That was very good.
How long have you been here?
Well, all right.
Very well then.
But he does so need a mother.
It is great.
He will live.
take them all.
In what part of the house?
It will take a little time.
Three, he said.
But what about me?
There was work to do.
And why is that?
Just look at her.
And what was his name?
Move on, then.
But where is he?
What a good thing it would be.
And what will they do with us?
Think it over.
She has a house?
Is it as good now?
The world is before you.
He went to him.
Show me the way.
They are here.
Will you take me to her?
