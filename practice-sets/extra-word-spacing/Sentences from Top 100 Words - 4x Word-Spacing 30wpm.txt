There he is, you see.
Is that her?
And do you like her?
How did you know about it?
Now what are we to do with you?
But when will that be?
There you are, he said.
How long has he been there?
There he is, she said.
He said no.
And what did you see?
When is it?
Now there is no more to be said.
Go on, he said.
Out of the way.
And what is that?
What was it about?
What are we to do?
What was it?
May we come in?
How was that?
You can have some.
What can we do, then?
But how is that?
Look at it.
Will you come and see her?
When was that?
Look at it this way.
You can do it.
You have it.
But what is it?
And is that all?
Who will go first?
Then what are you up to now?
So it is.
But WHAT DID you see?
Then make it up.
who, then, are you?
And when will you call?
Look at him.
And could she see him?
but what if it is?
Who are you?
What is that?
are you there?
And what was it for?
But it was of no use.
who can it be?
How did she do it?
but we can go and see.
And how did you find out?
What did you do then?
She has it.
But will he see it?
What is it for?
We have no water.
Has it come to this?
You know how it is with her.
Now is your time.
what is it?
And who is this?
Then, how do you know?
How did he do it?
But he had no time.
How are you?
Which is it?
There you are.
What have you come for?
What is it all about?
Would you like some?
Is it over?
Who is she?
But who was she?
And has it come to this?
Do as you will.
Do you see it?
Is that all?
You have them?
It was from you.
What DO you know of him?
But he had to have it.
and so on, and so on.
Do you see him?
At what number?
But what are you up to?
How is she?
Do you know what you look like?
Did you see it?
You can go.
Call him in.
Do they know him?
That is a long time.
Now you know.
What did he do to you?
Do you know him?
Look over it.
Had to look the other way.
Who was he?
Do as you like.
Look at them.
Did you know them?
We have him.
Do you know?
There they are.
Can one see from there?
So it was.
But so it is.
What is there to see?
What would she have said?
And what did you do then?
What was he like?
What do you see?
You may go.
What time is it?
what has she to do with it?
So there it was.
Is she like him?
How can you know?
Do you know what it is?
And who are you?
How can it be?
But how about you?
What did they do?
Can it be?
There were two of them.
So be it.
Do you know her?
But what will you do?
Or so they said.
but there was more to it than this.
Would you do what he did?
Do you like him?
What is it like?
Are you there?
Can you do that?
The time had come.
Is he there?
Is it like him?
So that was the way.
How did you come by it?
Who and what are you?
There he is, do you see him?
Then how many are there?
What will you do, then?
How is he now?
They said no more.
How would you like to have it?
Come this way.
That is what she did.
And who was that?
Then what is it?
What is he like?
No was there one?
No one will come, she said.
What do you make of that?
What can this be?
You know more than we do.
Tqhen you may go.
And what do you call her?
What is all this?
The time will come.
Did you see her?
How do you do?
There is but one thing to do.
Who was that?
That will do, said he.
What do you make of it?
What are you up to?
What do they call you?
What other way is there to look at it?
But what have they been up to?
Did you know him?
Will that do?
That was all she said.
That will do, he said.
One or two?
What is it about?
Did you know her?
Then there is more to do.
How is he?
That was it.
Then who are you?
When was it?
Is that it?
Is it time?
What could it be?
And what do you make of it?
And all for what?
And do you like him?
At what time?
But it has been so long.
Is it like him?
But how about you?
You can have some.
When is it?
Do as you will.
But will he see it?
Call him in.
Did you know him?
There he is, she said.
Had to look the other way.
What did you do then?
what is it?
But he had to have it.
but there was more to it than this.
How did she do it?
but what if it is?
How is she?
What is there to see?
And when will you call?
What have you come for?
There you are, he said.
But how is that?
Who is she?
At what number?
Do as you like.
But what is it?
Are you there?
One or two?
How is he?
They said no more.
And who is this?

And all for what?
It was from you.
Look over it.
What is it about?
But who was she?
What are you up to?
Do you know what you look like?
And who was that?
And what did you do then?
Do you see him?
Tqhen you may go.

At what time?
How did you come by it?
But WHAT DID you see?
You know how it is with her.

But he had no time.
What would she have said?
what has she to do with it?
What is he like?
What DO you know of him?
Come this way.
And do you like her?
May we come in?
Who will go first?
So be it.
No one will come, she said.
and so on, and so on.
And what do you make of it?
Is that it?
We have no water.
So there it was.
Can one see from there?
How did you know about it?
When was it?
What could it be?
So that was the way.
No was there one?
Then who are you?
But when will that be?
How can it be?
She has it.
Who and what are you?
The time had come.
Is it over?
Did you know her?
And who are you?
You can go.
But it was of no use.
Is he there?
What is all this?
Do you like him?
Now there is no more to be said.
Has it come to this?
Who are you?
Or so they said.
Would you like some?

Do you know him?
That was it.
Do you know?
How would you like to have it?
There is but one thing to do.
There he is, you see.
What was he like?
How do you do?
Look at it this way.
Then there is more to do.
What are we to do?
He said no.
But what will you do?
Then how many are there?
who, then, are you?
Did you see it?
And what was it for?
but we can go and see.
What did he do to you?
Will that do?
What do you make of that?
Then make it up.
Do you see it?
There you are.
Then what is it?
Do you know her?
Which is it?
But it has been so long.
You know more than we do.
Do they know him?
are you there?
Then what are you up to now?
What can we do, then?
Did you know them?
We have him.
And how did you find out?
Will you come and see her?
That is what she did.
Now what are we to do with you?
Did you see her?
And what is that?
What is it like?
Who was he?
What other way is there to look at it?
But what are you up to?
But what have they been up to?
And do you like him?
But so it is.
And is that all?
What was it about?
Out of the way.
Now you know.
Is it time?
So it was.
And what do you call her?
Now is your time.
Look at them.
There they are.
Look at it.
Do you know what it is?
How did he do it?
You have it.

Go on, he said.
Is that all?
How was that?
Then, how do you know?
What did they do?
What do you make of it?
That will do, said he.
And what did you see?
Who was that?
You may go.
Would you do what he did?
Can you do that?
And has it come to this?
