But why dont you want to take it?
But then it will be too late.
She came in just now by the back door.
Are you sure?
How did it begin?
Keep to the left.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Off with his head.
Have you never been there?
Let me see it.
But watch over him.
And who is this friend?
We should look at this.
This took place at his house, in his room.
A second man got up and went out.
Can you hear me?
Music is a good thing.
And now, good night.
Why, is it late?
Dont you think so?
Here is the paper.
Well, let us be sure of that.
He had two left feet.
Come at once.
What country does he come from?
She got up.
Let me see him at once.
You must never tell.
How many are left?
Only, dont look back.
But it is the same with any life.
Let me go to the door.
Here he is at last.
No, said the Tree.
So he began to help.
This is my country.
Now you must eat.
Is my father here?
Point it at his horse.
We may be too late.
But you must never tell.
Have you got that?
Are you my friend?
Think of my father.
But they may still come here.
Who did you learn that from?
Come let us see them.
Do you want to cross?
They may tell us to open it.
Keep watch all night.
No, dont.
How could you begin?
What did you hear?
It was his own room.
Let her go.
It was then time to start.
There was no letter for me.
Will you never learn?
Both of us.
It is well thought of.
Right here it began.
They dont know their own country.
Good night again.
Who said four?
Who was the letter from?
Look at his face.
Let us go back.
But she saw no one?
For once you are right.
And then we may begin.
He is my friend.
He may come close.
Who could have thought it?
Off with her head.
Well, run back to her.
We are together.
Ask one of those men.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Why should they?
Where is this city?
Is it in the city?
To the left.
Why do you stop here?
He is always at it.
They never did it again.
So take care of me.
Come, let us be men.
You should take me there one day.
And this food?
But now it is too late.
Then, good night.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
One never has too much.
Let me in.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Do you hear that?
You might want it.
There was no answer.
Do you have the letter?
Who found them out?
Let me get on with my work.
You must walk.
Do you often come back?
Let me say one thing.
Let me have a word with you.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
She is my friend.
Take care of him.
Where could you keep it?
He could run no more.
But let us walk.
Let me go back.
Well, read the letter again.
What a start that was.
She is still here?
We are very far from that.
But what did you hear?
Why dont you play?
It was very hard.
Sure of what?
Let him answer us.
Do you want some more to eat?
You are right, father.
Let us go in.
Why, it was one of his own men.
Do you know what he did last night?
Did you see his eye?
Let me hear what it is.
But you got to play music for them.
Here is the book.
Let me see him.
But then you would be close to the sea?
They came over last night.
What do you think of the music?
Let me get to work.
One was on a white horse.
There are only four of us.
We dont see it like that.
She came over last night.
Which story was it?
When did you begin?
What did he say in the letter?
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
At four, she said.
Any book will tell you that.
Do you know where he is?
She saw no one?
It might help.
The sun had set long since.
Tell her to begin.
In the country?
Keep to the right.
We should ask him.
He is my father.
Dont say that to me.
Still, you never know.
Dont you like it?
But hard to tell.
Just cut it out, will you?
They dont care.
Is there any answer?
She never came back.
You saw him?
You are sure of it?
At this time of my life, no.
Do you know how he made his mark?
It was the first thing he thought of.
He saw his men draw back.
It must be in her own house.
We got one and they got one.
He said at last.
Good night, friend.
Who can answer for that?
We were together.
She saw it.
What did he answer?
Just a few.
Let me hear your story.
Do you hear me?
Where is the river?
No, said her father.
Dont you want any?
And he left the room.
It is always so.
Let me out.
Stop and think.
One night more and he would be on his way.
No, never.
Come here, my friend.
Then let me have a word with you.
What is your real name?
You got me?
A call for help, you thought?
He has been been found.
And she left the room.
Who let you in?
Dont you see that?
Just cut it out.
At last we have a man.
It is so very kind of you both.
By and by he got it.
Open the door.
How could you let him go so far?
Call the next one.
What do you think when you hear music?
Few had found it.
You have a car?
This is real.
You must study.
Dont tell me.
It is music.
See him grow up.
She might be at his house.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Go to your father.
It was like new life to him.
Stop, said he.
So, once more, good night.
Watch over him.
He came at once.
They always know.
But are you sure of that?
Cut him down.
Say good night.
We never thought of that.
My father is right.
What was it that you thought?
And now let us go home.
Can you stand?
How much have you got?
It was white.
Good for the country.
It will be too late.
That is the idea.
Which end is his head?
The other night she left.
What would you have me do with my life?
He has children of his own.
But it was very late.
It is a long story.
But it is all all too late now.
What should he say?
Who took him out of it?
Let me know at once when you will start.
Have you been at sea?
Is he a real father?
She must have a hard time with him.
You must eat now.
Does he never go out?
Do you have a car?
And then they began to fish.
They never come back.
Cut your hand open?
And your children?
Are we too late?
Now or never.
But it would be in the paper.
The children will live just the same.
Are we late?
We must go at once.
Is it far?
Where has she run off to?
We must begin again.
This is what began it all.
Let them have it.
It is open?
Here we see the boy at school.
Was you in my room?
There is only food for one.
What a night it has been.
You will answer for it.
And why should they?
Always the same with you people.
You took it.
What do you hear?
We got under way at last.
Where have you been this long while?
Take care.
What is life to you?
Are you sure of it?
Have you found it?
What was the name of the man who took it?
How would they stop it?
Let me be and let me live.
Let us start, then.
And there are four of you?
What was left of him?
Here is the letter.
Is that far?
Who should it be?
Always the same, year after year.
He might still be up.
These were the first people we saw.
Let us cross over.
If you know, why dont you tell?
He then said, It is time to start.
Come over in the sun.
This took him some time.
what river is it?
We might learn a thing or two.
Why should this be so?
Life is all right.
That was the first night.
It was the last day of the year.
Well, what next?
Never see him again.
One of us will be here all night.
That night we were just in time.
Dont move, he said.
Write an answer.
Our own people must come first.
Do we stop here?
Stop, let me show you the way.
There to the left.
Let me look.
No, that can never be.
It would seem so.
It is from your father.
Why is he cross with me?
Watch him, he said.
We found it.
So it always was.
No, stop.
No, why should he?
He had only one night more to live.
There, do you hear?
Let me see her.
You found him?
Why dont you want to go?
Just set still and take it like a man.
He is at sea.
They are hard at it.
Let him follow me.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Have you got it?
Why, dont you hear it?
Come eat with me.
They are always the same.
How many children?
Tell me more.
We got to let that go.
There were few near me.
And what did you learn from him?
it took all that time to come over the water.
You are sure of that?
So they got out and went in.
But take care.
First turn to the left.
And what did you do with that letter?
Tell us a story.
Let him grow up with you.
Give me the letter.
Now let me have it.
