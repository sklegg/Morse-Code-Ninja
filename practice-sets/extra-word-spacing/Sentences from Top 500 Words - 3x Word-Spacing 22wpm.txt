My mind was soon made up.
Who gave it to you?
Well, but where can he fly to?
Yes, you are right.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Oh, dont ask me.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
He is among us.
Yes, sit down.
Is that a fact?
Stay where you are.
We are more strong together.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Never mind how he came here.
They all fall to the ground.
Oh, of course.
You brought no one with you?
Oh, if men only knew.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Can it be possible?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Oh, to be sure.
She heard and saw nothing.
Oh, all right.
Well, miss?
It must be done at once.
Money is power.
Well, of course.
He stood up.
Never mind that.
You must have a rest.
Oh, he is so kind.
At his side was a large green box.
A fine thing too.
Who brought you up?
All of this was possible.
There is no possible way.
Did she stay long?
Better sit still.
Go in there and drive them out.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
and so he decide he go back home.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
They know nothing about it.
But how long ago?
There was more to be done.
It is all done.
Yes, all right.
Sit down, he said.
Oh, very well, he said.
Perhaps he did.
Behind every book is a man.
What is done is done.
Fine, very fine.
Behind my bed.
How long would you keep me in town?
What age is he?
Half the town was there.
But let us see your plan.
This is a test.
We must be quick.
Come, and we can rest together.
Do you see that island?
Yes, he did.
Just go to sleep.
What brought you here?
The old man gave no answer.
All was dark.
Come quick.
It was done.
Yes, that was a picture book.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Do you talk in your sleep?
In her name, then, let it be done.
Yes and no.
Oh, do the best you can.
It was brought to me.
Well, what about my plan?
Let her wait.
Oh, take me with you.
What has he done?
Why, of course.
This made him wonder more and more.
Let him go free?
Help me sit up.
He must be in the same boat as us.
She could think of nothing more to say.
No, nothing at all.
Yes, go on.
He is in the box.
Where can you wait for me?
How is that done?
You will fall.
Very well, wait a minute.
Bring this with you.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
It was a kind of language between us.
Did she fall?
Why should my father fly?
It is a real bed.
He ran up to them.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
But she is nothing to me now.
Get to bed.
It was a warm night.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
What have you done?
But what must be done?
Decide if you are going back home.
She gave me her hand.
Quick, friend, quick.
It is no use, said a voice.
Oh, just listen.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Yes, it is true.
Nothing she can eat?
They need a rest.
In that town there is a street.
There is no one in that room behind you.
No, nothing of the kind.
Oh, but you were there?
Well, sit down.
The whole day had been hot.
What have they done?
Of course she will.
How long ago?
But what then must be done?
Look at that dark water.
It was a record run.
Oh, that is very simple.
It was so long ago.
And yet you said he had money.
Why does the boat go so fast?
He brought it with him for us to see.
Which box do you mean?
Nothing at all.
Good to rest once in a way.
Yes, it did.
Well, there he stood.
This voice was that of my father.
Yes, we know that.
He must wait.
Fly, my friend.
Oh, no.
Well, sit down by me.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
How was it done?
Again came the voice.
Yes, she was back.
And yet you are the better off?
Yes, once.
The night was very dark.
His first cry was for his father.
You love a certain person.
Is my father in town?
Well then, be quick.
What is power?
You can hear that, miss?
Go back to bed.
Oh, do as you like.
But wait a minute.
Hold on a minute.
The island was a mile long.
Sit down, said the old man.
They call him a fine boy.
Leave the rest to me.
Your voice is that of a young man.
And then the game began all over again.
The little boy lay in his bed.
And he told you nothing?
Oh, tell me.
The night was dark.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
How was that possible?
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Of course it might.
Oh, you are there.
What can be done?
Oh, go on.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Did it all rest on me?
He knew nothing.
Go and rest.
Free to do what?
All right then, sit down.
Will you rest here a little?
Oh, that.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Yes, what is it?
See what you have done.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Yes, to be sure.
Play the game out.
And here is the note.
Wait a second.
He will sleep an hour.
Of course they will.
Oh, this is too much.
They would cry.
Oh, do you know?
He never said nothing.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Well yes, you are right.
Clear the table.
Are they on foot?
Come, let me show you my plan.
It was so very long ago.
It was very dark.
Of course he was right.
Be back in a minute.
If only they would be quick.
Then lead the way.
Laugh, if you will.
Take good note of it.
Yes, that is true.
You must stay.
That would be a fine thing.
It might have done me good.
She got her hand free.
It is possible.
But they could see nothing.
Nothing could have been better.
Lead me to him.
Nothing is more simple.
We brought them in.
It is nothing.
Bring them here.
Wait and see.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Yes, she could sing that.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
His plan is very simple.
You are free to do so.
He has a good voice still.
Just let us go free.
Are you strong?
He had, to be sure, done much.
Wonder is it like that.
What more is to be done?
He had made up his mind.
It is time for bed.
Yes, there it is.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Keep clear of him.
She was still game.
In a minute.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Yes, but what did she say?
And what a voice she has.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Did he fall?
It is certain.
Wait a minute.
That is possible.
Nothing had come of it.
It has to be done.
The city was soon behind me.
You knew it, and said nothing?
It is very clear.
Oh let me in.
You can sleep here.
Yes, very well.
Then it is certain?
Answer me that, miss.
You are in my power.
Is it certain?
Dont laugh.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
All that for nothing?
Try to sleep.
Be quick, for the time is short.
But it must be done soon.
You better stay here all night.
Yes, said the old man.
The water ran dry.
Do you have my note?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Yes, go and find out.
What have they done with my work?
There is nothing more to be said.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
There, by the wheel.
It was a very dark night.
I hear his voice in the house.
It is done.
Bring it here.
You could see there was a story behind it.
You must stay with me.
Why did you bring him here?
The whole night the tree stood still.
There is your old bed.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Then all was dark again.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Is he in bed?
Wonder what he does.
It was cold and dark.
What kind of voice is it?
It must be done.
What did the letter contain?
Then bring them to me, she said.
Never mind me.
We are free to act and think.
And you can do nothing until then?
is it come yet?
Yes, of course.
Is it possible?
Like these in shape and size?
And what have you done to me?
It stood behind the door.
There is a lot of people.
Yes, and no.
Of course it is.
How can a little dog laugh?
And sit in the dark?
It was full of people.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
His will be done.
Wait for me.
It was right in front of us.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
My mind is made up.
He gave me this paper.
He saw nothing.
You know you must say yes.
Yes, he said.
Wonder if he has a name.
It was a cold, dark night.
He was here a minute ago.
The snow is deep.
Clear the way.
Yes, she said.
Is that possible?
It was hot.
Money is no object?
Let us sit down.
Oh, take those off.
He left long ago.
What a game.
He began to laugh.
Yes, my love?
It was a dark night.
Then he must be a wonder.
Oh, how can you sleep?
But never mind that.
That is a fact.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Here is our plan.
Oh, come now.
It is his voice.
Now we must wait.
But that is nothing to us.
You know nothing about it.
Clear my name.
Her voice was low.
That was well done.
Let me see your plan.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Nothing new under the sun.
Nothing could be more simple.
Oh, man.
She began to cry.
Oh, nothing.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
What has brought you here?
