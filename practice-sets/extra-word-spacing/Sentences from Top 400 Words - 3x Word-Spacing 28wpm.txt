You have your whole life before you, she said.
Much of it was true.
Let me see him, said the young man.
What does he feel?
Then what would happen?
No less, no more.
Now, listen.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Pull together.
Better cross here.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
Where are you off to so early?
That was the rule, she said.
Are you ready to play?
The family was at home.
You love him?
He is very simple.
Your true father?
It is a young girl.
Let us talk about you.
Do you remember me?
You must leave that to me.
You may leave the room.
Leave me out of the question.
Light my fire.
If you know it, that is enough.
And dont talk to me.
An example would be better.
Fire and water, earth and air.
You remember the place, my father?
Never heard of it before.
Half a mile?
Have you heard?
When did this happen?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Put down three and carry five.
Every word you said was heard.
That may be true.
He is better than any of you.
They told me to.
Try it on the dog first.
And that is the whole point.
Had they been heard?
Why do we love?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
That is very simple.
They had much to talk about.
She told me to ask you.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Five young children.
He said, get him out of the road.
I have no children to love me.
And you will always love him?
This money was for her.
Take a hold of it.
They left in the morning.
You are right, my love.
She was a good girl.
We got her half way.
As soon as you left, it began.
You had better go.
He put his hand over part of the map.
She is fast?
We took our leave early, and left together.
They are still young.
Made me feel so young.
He had enough of it.
You are better than that.
You were told.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Young man, you will go far.
Do you own a dog?
Listen to me.
And why do you serve?
But what did we ever get for it?
who told you you could?
Is your man white or black?
He had my love.
It is a fire.
Let me also ask you a question.
We knew them both.
You are on a ship?
The rock was very small.
What kind of a bird?
You can pass through the door.
How many children did he leave?
But he never heard me.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Let us pass.
When do you leave?
We call it black.
Keep in step.
It was true.
How short his time.
Are you all ready?
Why do they want to make her sing?
You are in love with me?
you know better than that.
How does this happen?
It is the rule.
It has been there ever since.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
Let me remember what he said.
And so they knew that it was true.
Did you get any money?
We dont know enough.
What have you against me now?
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
About the usual time.
Ask them to sing one more song.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Is your family well?
What size do you want?
She was so young, too.
It would have been more simple.
It would be better if you went to the war.
And then he told all he knew.
Pull it more to your side.
What a question.
She is very plain.
It can never happen.
What is there to talk about?
The world is big enough.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
Does he love you?
How do you feel?
Listen to him.
you should know her better than me.
Had you heard?
Before you leave, tell us.
She was only a little girl.
Answer me this one question.
She is much better.
He has money.
Against what side?
Will you answer that question?
We were up early.
The night was cold and still.
Better write it here.
There are four hundred?
Little girl, where have you been?
Are we ready?
But enough of this.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Are you here on leave?
We had a list.
What have you heard?
Have you a family?
How soon will he be here?
The King Went to him.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Do you love her much?
We must make the best of it.
You may go, said the King.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Have you told her?
Is the wind north or south?
It was a round table.
But listen to this, he said.
Ten, did you say?
Feel better then.
Never heard of it.
Leave off that.
Hold her hand.
It is true.
Pass this way, then.
And serve them right.
Can it be true?
How does it feel?
We had better go in.
Where he was, no one knew.
We are ready.
Was he young or old?
This is my body.
A house is on fire?
But let that pass.
So we came down this road.
So do you, my love.
What do you mean by that question?
Listen to them, he said.
That would be the best way.
Leave any for him?
Let us talk a little about my father.
No, he is a man about my size.
To know her is to love her.
She knew what was good for children.
No more money?
Do you remember?
You must travel.
That must be true.
He will leave me.
Now listen to me.
If you only knew.
Who told you that?
We serve them.
What will happen now?
One other question, said he.
This was true.
So the question was, what to do?
How do you feel now?
But why must you leave me so soon?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Did you tell him your whole story?
And will you direct us?
From then on it was war between them.
You saw the person?
A young man?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
The dog is always with him.
Are you better?
They had heard all that before.
In an hour?
It will interest you, said he.
What will happen to us?
Let me hear from you soon.
That is enough for me.
Let us leave them, she said.
You will soon know.
Better late than never.
Does she go fast?
Can she sing?
No, my love.
Long live the king.
Are they made to order?
The night was cold.
He got it this morning.
Who told you so?
This is simple.
They all heard me.
But listen to me.
It was all she could do to hold in.
Do you want any money?
How did this happen?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Has she any family?
Then get ready at once.
Do you remember him?
She told me all about it.
Let that pass.
You are right, young man.
Ten will be early enough.
Look to the west.
It is cold.
Are you in love with her?
Who was it told me his name?
Your watch is slow.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Take notice.
What can happen?
Do you love me?
She knew at once.
It is a rock.
What a state he was in.
what could be better?
This will pass in no time.
She must be told.
Remember that time?
It was true to life.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
You are cold.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
She had very little notice from him.
That was the question.
Did they ever go back?
A better man than you.
He knew them.
Well, are you ready?
They can have all our half of the house.
How could that happen?
Why talk to me?
Let this man pass.
That is true.
Is that true?
Do you know that old lay?
Are you ready?
We will talk about that.
She is the first person in this house.
Why do you serve?
What is love?
Well, young man?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Take good care of the little girl.
It was cold.
Can you sing?
Have you heard from him often?
They knew it.
How far from the body?
Half as many is too much.
In short, take me.
And what does she want the money for?
And you are still so young.
He never heard.
Which king?
Long and the short of it.
But how simple it is.
Are you still cold?
An hour and a half.
But she is very young.
But one day you must feel it.
On fire, on fire.
Did he though?
you must step out.
You are a good girl.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
He said, the work is now complete.
And so they began to talk.
Never heard of him.
He never told us what it was she said.
Hold it up to the light.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
And you can sing?
Is it true?
You know me well enough.
Listen to this, will you?
Read them, said the King.
They had several children.
You have an hour.
That is enough.
Why did it happen?
You will always love him?
And how did he make his money?
Then you will know me better.
Where did they get the money from?
There was no wind.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
