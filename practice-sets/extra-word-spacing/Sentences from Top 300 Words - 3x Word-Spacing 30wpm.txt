Look at his face.
If you know, why dont you tell?
And what did you do with that letter?
Point it at his horse.
We found it.
That was the first night.
She is still here?
Stop, let me show you the way.
It was like new life to him.
Come over in the sun.
It was the last day of the year.
One never has too much.
Music is a good thing.
But it was very late.
Is it far?
There are only four of us.
What did he say in the letter?
Who said four?
He saw his men draw back.
But watch over him.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Just cut it out.
Good for the country.
But let us walk.
Is there any answer?
And this food?
So it always was.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Come eat with me.
We never thought of that.
Now you must eat.
Let me go to the door.
Call the next one.
Still, you never know.
It is open?
But she saw no one?
Dont say that to me.
Let me know at once when you will start.
Well, what next?
It is always so.
Come let us see them.
It is a long story.
Is he a real father?
Why should this be so?
What do you hear?
Let me go back.
By and by he got it.
Who let you in?
Why should they?
A second man got up and went out.
Well, read the letter again.
Dont move, he said.
Who could have thought it?
Do you know how he made his mark?
How would they stop it?
It was his own room.
But you got to play music for them.
It will be too late.
But it is all all too late now.
You are sure of it?
You got me?
So he began to help.
Who found them out?
No, stop.
Sure of what?
Why dont you want to go?
She might be at his house.
You saw him?
Always the same, year after year.
What a night it has been.
And then they began to fish.
Do you want some more to eat?
She came over last night.
No, said the Tree.
Go to your father.
But are you sure of that?
But then you would be close to the sea?
Do you know where he is?
First turn to the left.
They are hard at it.
Let me see him.
Let her go.
There is only food for one.
He came at once.
So they got out and went in.
But it is the same with any life.
Open the door.
You might want it.
No, why should he?
We are together.
Are you sure of it?
This is real.
What was it that you thought?
But take care.
Let them have it.
She never came back.
Watch over him.
Dont tell me.
She got up.
Only, dont look back.
Can you hear me?
You should take me there one day.
How many are left?
We must begin again.
Do we stop here?
We should ask him.
Tell me more.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Right here it began.
It is well thought of.
He then said, It is time to start.
It is music.
You are right, father.
He might still be up.
Take care.
We might learn a thing or two.
Come at once.
We are very far from that.
Do you often come back?
You will answer for it.
Now let me have it.
And now let us go home.
He had two left feet.
Both of us.
He has been been found.
And he left the room.
Let me in.
Do you have a car?
These were the first people we saw.
Do you have the letter?
You must walk.
He said at last.
He is at sea.
You have a car?
That night we were just in time.
There was no answer.
How could you let him go so far?
It was white.
Come, let us be men.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Stop and think.
What should he say?
The children will live just the same.
We should look at this.
But what did you hear?
Stop, said he.
What country does he come from?
See him grow up.
When did you begin?
Let us go in.
Keep to the right.
Why, it was one of his own men.
It must be in her own house.
Tell her to begin.
And she left the room.
Do you hear me?
Come here, my friend.
He may come close.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Dont you like it?
Who did you learn that from?
Let me say one thing.
Let me hear what it is.
To the left.
Good night again.
Keep watch all night.
Here he is at last.
Think of my father.
Will you never learn?
How much have you got?
And why should they?
Just a few.
Do you know what he did last night?
But then it will be too late.
We were together.
Dont you want any?
How could you begin?
A call for help, you thought?
There to the left.
They never come back.
Who should it be?
No, dont.
One was on a white horse.
Never see him again.
Let him follow me.
They dont know their own country.
Take care of him.
Which story was it?
Let me see him at once.
Let me be and let me live.
One of us will be here all night.
Where could you keep it?
At this time of my life, no.
No, said her father.
Do you want to cross?
Dont you see that?
You are sure of that?
Why, is it late?
What did you hear?
It is from your father.
And then we may begin.
Let me have a word with you.
Cut your hand open?
Here is the book.
And your children?
We got one and they got one.
You took it.
Where has she run off to?
Where is this city?
Where is the river?
Well, run back to her.
Did you see his eye?
Why do you stop here?
They dont care.
What did he answer?
Well, let us be sure of that.
Cut him down.
Let me see it.
He could run no more.
Let me get on with my work.
Have you got it?
Is that far?
At last we have a man.
Let him answer us.
Have you been at sea?
What do you think of the music?
She saw it.
And who is this friend?
He is always at it.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
It was very hard.
Give me the letter.
Are we too late?
Just cut it out, will you?
They came over last night.
Dont you think so?
They always know.
Say good night.
There, do you hear?
We may be too late.
Life is all right.
In the country?
What would you have me do with my life?
But why dont you want to take it?
Let us start, then.
She is my friend.
We got under way at last.
Few had found it.
No, never.
Is my father here?
Now or never.
And what did you learn from him?
They are always the same.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Then, good night.
Does he never go out?
Ask one of those men.
It might help.
Write an answer.
For once you are right.
She must have a hard time with him.
There was no letter for me.
Who took him out of it?
Do you hear that?
It was then time to start.
Why, dont you hear it?
That is the idea.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
This took him some time.
Watch him, he said.
What is life to you?
it took all that time to come over the water.
At four, she said.
Here is the letter.
Tell us a story.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Which end is his head?
Any book will tell you that.
You must never tell.
Is it in the city?
They may tell us to open it.
Was you in my room?
Let me see her.
Let us go back.
Our own people must come first.
what river is it?
What a start that was.
Have you never been there?
But now it is too late.
What do you think when you hear music?
Then let me have a word with you.
Good night, friend.
And now, good night.
And there are four of you?
You must eat now.
But they may still come here.
The sun had set long since.
She came in just now by the back door.
Off with her head.
Let me look.
Are we late?
Who was the letter from?
But you must never tell.
You found him?
It would seem so.
He is my father.
Let us cross over.
What was the name of the man who took it?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
So take care of me.
What was left of him?
But it would be in the paper.
Keep to the left.
It is so very kind of you both.
This is my country.
Why dont you play?
There were few near me.
Here is the paper.
The other night she left.
We must go at once.
Can you stand?
This is what began it all.
He had only one night more to live.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
They never did it again.
Are you my friend?
She saw no one?
Let me hear your story.
But hard to tell.
Let me get to work.
We got to let that go.
Let him grow up with you.
Where have you been this long while?
Here we see the boy at school.
What is your real name?
How did it begin?
So, once more, good night.
Have you found it?
We dont see it like that.
Why is he cross with me?
Always the same with you people.
Let me out.
How many children?
My father is right.
No, that can never be.
Have you got that?
Who can answer for that?
He is my friend.
Off with his head.
Are you sure?
You must study.
He has children of his own.
