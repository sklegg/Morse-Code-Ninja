Get to work.
Here it is.
Where is he?
Where does he live?
He went to him.
Been back long?
Hand it in.
Put it on.
But you must.
You know, you see right through people.
Well, go on.
Such as what?
What is your name?
You were near him.
How old was she?
Where did he come from?
this one, too?
Good, he said.
What is his name?
He was so kind.
Call me what you will, he said.
You must tell me.
There is more to tell.
What do they say was the cause?
To what end?
Is it any good?
Give me your hand.
There is the little boy.
Now, you know me.
Who will tell her?
Well, tell me.
What will each of you give?
What was his name?
Did you tell him?
Then what kind is it?
How on earth do you know?
What do you want me to do?
And it did me good.
where did she come from?
You must come now.
Think no more about that.
What could she mean by it?
Which house is it?
Do you want me to do it?
Now it was time to act.
And off we go.
For some man.
At your house?
What did you say your name was?
Good day, one and all.
Why are you here?
Look at me.
But where is he?
Give me my work.
Are you here for good?
Where are you off to?
What do you want to ask these people?
Take this and this.
You see it every day.
What does she think about me?
Can you point it out to me?
Now we see the light.
Well then, what do you want?
He is at my house.
That was a house to look at.
Will you take me to her?
What does all this mean?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
It would be very kind of you.
What have you been after?
What could set you off in the first place?
And what do you think?
there are only two.
He has more to give.
Tell me about it.
Well, read it.
Can you help me find my way?
How does she use you?
Look at it other way round.
Think it over.
Then why are you here?
Where are we to turn for help?
What on earth do you mean?
Try it on.
In what part of the house?
take them all.
And who is the man?
Too much of this.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Very well, show him to me.
If you want to know, go and find out.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
It is very kind of you.
Is that right?
There, that does me good.
They had all been very good to us.
One, two, three.
Give him air.
When will it take place?
Well, how are you?
Why, what is it, then?
Do you think she was?
Is it as good now?
Is it all right?
What do they want?
And a very good thing, too.
Go and try.
There was no one near.
It is the same thing.
Show me the way.
When will her mother come?
You can say what it is.
Can you take me?
You are most kind.
They are here.
Where are you?
You can help me here.
This is the man.
But he is right.
And they went home.
Ask her, he said.
But it is just so with the world.
How does he use it?
And where is it?
Now come here.
Just like me.
Well, here he is.
He was at work again.
What will you say?
Tell us all about it.
do you come from the end of the world?
Is it large?
Here is the way we put in the time.
Is this the man?
It is great.
Read that, she said.
And why is that?
What do you mean?
I would like to see her again in that.
Tell me his name.
And where is he now?
And what did he say?
He was here.
Large or small?
What is that in your hand?
And what will they do with us?
After three, he said.
Some day you may ask me about it.
Tell me all about it.
He will live.
Come with me, then.
But why do you ask me?
Would you now like to look round my place?
Do you think so?
Why, what do you mean?
Well, did he?
How much do you want?
We will say no more about it, then.
This is the first act.
Where are you from?
Why are you like this?
Turn this way.
Where in the world did you come from?
There is no place like home.
Who are these men?
Very well, he said.
Well, and is that all?
Where is he now?
Will you come with me?
Were you here before me?
And in she went.
Why did he come?
You are a good boy.
What does she want?
See, they are here.
What you have just said is good, very good.
And do you know why?
Are you back again?
You must take me with you.
Well, what do you think about it?
But where are we to go?
But what about me?
Is he a good man?
That is all one can say about her.
But what does it mean?
You are right.
Here it is, he said.
How can you tell?
She was the cause of it all.
Give me more than that
Much good that would be.
Say no more.
Is there some for me?
What did you say that for?
How old are you?
And what are they made of?
And have you been here long?
What is in your hand?
Do it for me.
It will take a little time.
Follow me, said the man.
Here is my hand.
How can you find out?
That would be very good.
But what did you want?
There was work to do.
She came up to them.
Why is that?
What would you have me do?
But this is the point.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
That was a good time.
Are you at it again?
Is he big?
When will he come back?
Now tell me.
It is very high.
She has been with him many long years.
Where do they get that?
All in good time.
How do you take it?
In what year?
What do you want?
But why do you ask?
You are all very kind to me.
Give it me.
What did he tell you?
He was there too.
They want more.
Are they like each other?
Where have they been?
Play with them.
Will you try?
How did you get here?
Why do you want water?
Where do you live?
And what did she say?
And how did you find out?
The world is before you.
How can you think of such a thing?
Where have you been?
That is right, said the old man.
What do you think of this?
How long have you been here?
Do you think so now?
It was high time.
You think so?
That is just my point.
Is that all you want?
And what is her name?
And what was his name?
What on earth does this mean?
She went on.
He will ask for it.
What more could a man ask for?
You think so, too?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
She had to tell him.
The first act was over.
But where is it?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Move on, then.
Then they will follow you?
What does it all mean?
No, tell me.
Come with me.
Have you been here long?
What do you think of that?
She has a house?
What did he say?
Give me a light.
How much are they?
We must come back.
Who is that man?
We are who we say we are.
Only two there now.
Get out of the way.
Is there no one who can help me?
How did that help you?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Then will come our time.
Ask him to show up?
For how much?
And where was the place?
And how in the world did you find them?
Give it to me, then.
Show it to me.
What do you think of her?
Show me the way he went.
Where could he be?
Say no more about it.
It must be where you put it.
Think of him.
What do you think of him?
How did you get me out?
Read that, he said.
Why are they here?
He said too much.
Very well then.
There is no one here to see.
Good day to you.
Here she is.
Where is she?
See, here it is.
Say what you want.
She was right.
Get out and play.
You will get on in the world.
It is all the same.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
That is the end of her.
What does one live for?
Well, how did it go?
There she is again.
Why do you want to know?
Why is he here?
Where are they off to now?
But he does so need a mother.
And that was the end of it.
Do you know me?
Well then, tell him so.
Now, what do you want with me?
And where is she, then?
Where are we?
Where did you place it?
How could she say such a thing.
Well, all right.
Just look at her.
And where is this man?
Is she well?
Come and help me.
Well, what do you think?
He went on his way.
Where to, now?
Tell us your name.
That is right.
Time to get out.
There will just be time.
What do you play?
What a good thing it would be.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
This is my point.
We are here.
Now, go home.
Is it you or me?
And how old were you at that time?
He said that that would help.
No, mother.
But who was your mother?
And what about your mother?
What do you mean by that?
This for me?
Now where did they come from?
Come with me to the little house.
Well, and what do you think?
Three, he said.
That was very good.
How can you say that?
Take some, she said.
All right, then.
Think what you will.
Too much for me now.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
What does he mean?
What was it you said to me?
Tell me who made the world.
Just look through it.
Too much in the way.
