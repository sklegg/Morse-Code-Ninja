It was a round table.
Then get ready at once.
Ten, did you say?
Are you ready to play?
Who told you that?
She is very plain.
Your true father?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Half a mile?
But how simple it is.
He had enough of it.
It will interest you, said he.
And how did he make his money?
Who told you so?
Then you will know me better.
Five young children.
Pull it more to your side.
They can have all our half of the house.
Why do we love?
Let me also ask you a question.
You know me well enough.
Remember that time?
But listen to this, he said.
You may leave the room.
No, he is a man about my size.
But she is very young.
That is enough.
He had my love.
And then he told all he knew.
That was the question.
You will soon know.
Let us pass.
Fire and water, earth and air.
A better man than you.
That may be true.
You saw the person?
Did he though?
One other question, said he.
Ten will be early enough.
Against what side?
It is a rock.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Long and the short of it.
Are you in love with her?
They told me to.
They all heard me.
How does this happen?
She told me to ask you.
She told me all about it.
What is there to talk about?
A young man?
How do you feel?
Can it be true?
And that is the whole point.
That was the rule, she said.
An hour and a half.
And so they began to talk.
You had better go.
She is fast?
She is much better.
Who was it told me his name?
Try it on the dog first.
What size do you want?
And what does she want the money for?
What does he feel?
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
What will happen now?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Pull together.
He is better than any of you.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Does she go fast?
I have no children to love me.
They had much to talk about.
That is enough for me.
We dont know enough.
Does he love you?
What a question.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Have you a family?
That is very simple.
And you will always love him?
But he never heard me.
What kind of a bird?
Are you still cold?
Let me hear from you soon.
They knew it.
What have you heard?
Have you heard?
Better late than never.
You are in love with me?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
Listen to them, he said.
You are better than that.
A house is on fire?
We had a list.
So we came down this road.
Well, young man?
We were up early.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Do you own a dog?
This money was for her.
You will always love him?
Leave any for him?
Where are you off to so early?
Is your man white or black?
You must travel.
The King Went to him.
you must step out.
You must leave that to me.
Listen to him.
Take a hold of it.
How short his time.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
An example would be better.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Little girl, where have you been?
Feel better then.
It was true to life.
And you can sing?
Let us leave them, she said.
Are they made to order?
Never heard of it.
How many children did he leave?
Do you want any money?
It would have been more simple.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Take good care of the little girl.
Now, listen.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
She knew at once.
Never heard of it before.
Made me feel so young.
They had heard all that before.
You have an hour.
You remember the place, my father?
And why do you serve?
The night was cold and still.
She was a good girl.
If you only knew.
You are a good girl.
Can you sing?
It is cold.
Ask them to sing one more song.
How does it feel?
She is the first person in this house.
This is my body.
It was cold.
He said, the work is now complete.
She had very little notice from him.
It can never happen.
The dog is always with him.
Your watch is slow.
No less, no more.
Do you remember me?
They left in the morning.
We call it black.
And will you direct us?
Leave me out of the question.
When did this happen?
Is it true?
Half as many is too much.
He will leave me.
What can happen?
There was no wind.
You are right, young man.
Are you better?
Where he was, no one knew.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Did they ever go back?
Are you all ready?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
He never told us what it was she said.
Is your family well?
Why do you serve?
Had they been heard?
Look to the west.
Are you ready?
Do you remember him?
About the usual time.
Is the wind north or south?
Let me remember what he said.
Pass this way, then.
It is true.
you know better than that.
But what did we ever get for it?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Read them, said the King.
But why must you leave me so soon?
You were told.
But let that pass.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
It is the rule.
What a state he was in.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
We are ready.
Did you tell him your whole story?
No, my love.
They are still young.
We got her half way.
The world is big enough.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Never heard of him.
Put down three and carry five.
Better write it here.
Have you heard from him often?
This is simple.
But enough of this.
And you are still so young.
Listen to me.
You are cold.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
What is love?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Keep in step.
It has been there ever since.
On fire, on fire.
Is that true?
You may go, said the King.
From then on it was war between them.
Had you heard?
And so they knew that it was true.
Let that pass.
Take notice.
It was true.
You love him?
Every word you said was heard.
Now listen to me.
Then what would happen?
That must be true.
Why talk to me?
Have you told her?
She was only a little girl.
Let us talk a little about my father.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
what could be better?
Leave off that.
How could that happen?
That is true.
Has she any family?
Let us talk about you.
We must make the best of it.
Are you here on leave?
How far from the body?
He got it this morning.
This will pass in no time.
There are four hundred?
The rock was very small.
How soon will he be here?
Better cross here.
Did you get any money?
It would be better if you went to the war.
And dont talk to me.
Let me see him, said the young man.
Do you know that old lay?
It was all she could do to hold in.
Do you remember?
Can she sing?
Where did they get the money from?
The family was at home.
How did this happen?
So the question was, what to do?
Was he young or old?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
In short, take me.
As soon as you left, it began.
She must be told.
you should know her better than me.
Why did it happen?
Which king?
He said, get him out of the road.
Answer me this one question.
You are on a ship?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
No more money?
In an hour?
Will you answer that question?
If you know it, that is enough.
What do you mean by that question?
who told you you could?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
Light my fire.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
But one day you must feel it.
But listen to me.
He never heard.
He is very simple.
Are we ready?
Hold it up to the light.
You can pass through the door.
It is a fire.
The night was cold.
He knew them.
To know her is to love her.
Let this man pass.
We serve them.
We had better go in.
He put his hand over part of the map.
What have you against me now?
She knew what was good for children.
Why do they want to make her sing?
It is a young girl.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
How do you feel now?
This was true.
Do you love her much?
What will happen to us?
Hold her hand.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Well, are you ready?
We knew them both.
Young man, you will go far.
Much of it was true.
He has money.
They had several children.
Long live the king.
We will talk about that.
So do you, my love.
She was so young, too.
You are right, my love.
Do you love me?
That would be the best way.
Listen to this, will you?
And serve them right.
Before you leave, tell us.
When do you leave?
