Of course it is.
What has he done?
It must be done.
No, nothing of the kind.
He brought it with him for us to see.
But let us see your plan.
Well, of course.
But they could see nothing.
It was so long ago.
It must be done at once.
Nothing could have been better.
Did she stay long?
Oh, but you were there?
It was a cold, dark night.
Bring them here.
No, nothing at all.
Yes, but what did she say?
Then he must be a wonder.
Here is our plan.
He stood up.
Oh, tell me.
Who brought you up?
It was very dark.
It is nothing.
Yes, he did.
Why, of course.
Never mind me.
Nothing could be more simple.
Decide if you are going back home.
Did it all rest on me?
What more is to be done?
Why should my father fly?
And then the game began all over again.
The island was a mile long.
We brought them in.
Laugh, if you will.
Yes, what is it?
He knew nothing.
He had made up his mind.
Yes, she could sing that.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Yes, said the old man.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Let him go free?
They all fall to the ground.
That would be a fine thing.
It is a real bed.
They need a rest.
Yes, there it is.
Is it certain?
Nothing is more simple.
Well, there he stood.
And he told you nothing?
Oh, do as you like.
Oh, nothing.
Yes, he said.
We must be quick.
Yes, that is true.
Oh, man.
What is power?
Is that possible?
You better stay here all night.
It was done.
Go and rest.
But it must be done soon.
Well yes, you are right.
Of course he was right.
Clear my name.
Oh, that.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Help me sit up.
There is no one in that room behind you.
But wait a minute.
Perhaps he did.
Yes, it is true.
They would cry.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Money is power.
Oh, take me with you.
But never mind that.
Again came the voice.
He began to laugh.
Never mind how he came here.
He never said nothing.
You must have a rest.
There was more to be done.
Is that a fact?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
What can be done?
Bring it here.
and so he decide he go back home.
Let us sit down.
At his side was a large green box.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Lead me to him.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
They call him a fine boy.
Oh, no.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
And sit in the dark?
Hold on a minute.
Can it be possible?
But how long ago?
His plan is very simple.
Well then, be quick.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
It is possible.
Why did you bring him here?
The little boy lay in his bed.
Of course they will.
It is certain.
In her name, then, let it be done.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Oh, that is very simple.
Money is no object?
What is done is done.
Well, what about my plan?
Half the town was there.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Quick, friend, quick.
Yes, go on.
And yet you said he had money.
Oh, take those off.
How can a little dog laugh?
It is all done.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
She gave me her hand.
He left long ago.
I hear his voice in the house.
It was a kind of language between us.
Are they on foot?
Oh, to be sure.
Yes, she said.
Free to do what?
But she is nothing to me now.
Oh, of course.
Oh, if men only knew.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
See what you have done.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Nothing new under the sun.
Well, sit down.
He gave me this paper.
That was well done.
Dont laugh.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
But that is nothing to us.
What brought you here?
Fine, very fine.
Wonder if he has a name.
Very well, wait a minute.
Bring this with you.
You will fall.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Yes, go and find out.
But what must be done?
It is done.
We are free to act and think.
It was a warm night.
Oh, do the best you can.
Where can you wait for me?
All right then, sit down.
There is a lot of people.
Oh, very well, he said.
Well, miss?
He has a good voice still.
It was a very dark night.
His first cry was for his father.
It was a dark night.
Yes, but only for you and me.
You love a certain person.
The whole night the tree stood still.
How was it done?
Answer me that, miss.
Oh, all right.
The city was soon behind me.
Did she fall?
Let her wait.
In that town there is a street.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Did he fall?
Yes, it did.
The whole day had been hot.
Wonder what he does.
This voice was that of my father.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Yes, of course.
Keep clear of him.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Sit down, said the old man.
Look at that dark water.
Come, let me show you my plan.
And what a voice she has.
How long would you keep me in town?
She began to cry.
He must wait.
It was full of people.
And here is the note.
Behind every book is a man.
The old man gave no answer.
In a minute.
Yes, my love?
Who gave it to you?
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Yes, she was back.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
And you can do nothing until then?
Nothing at all.
The night was dark.
Clear the table.
Clear the way.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Like these in shape and size?
You know nothing about it.
Stay where you are.
There is nothing more to be said.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Oh, he is so kind.
It was so very long ago.
That is possible.
All of this was possible.
What kind of voice is it?
It was brought to me.
Do you see that island?
It was hot.
There is no possible way.
Just go to sleep.
There, by the wheel.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Go back to bed.
Of course it might.
Better sit still.
Is it possible?
You brought no one with you?
Wait a second.
And what have you done to me?
Oh, go on.
My mind was soon made up.
Oh, do you know?
Yes, we know that.
Leave the rest to me.
Go in there and drive them out.
His will be done.
Behind my bed.
Yes, you are right.
She was still game.
He had, to be sure, done much.
It is very clear.
Well, sit down by me.
It was a record run.
Oh, dont ask me.
He is among us.
He is in the box.
You are in my power.
How was that possible?
Yes, sit down.
Your voice is that of a young man.
He will sleep an hour.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Wait and see.
Nothing she can eat?
We are more strong together.
Oh, how can you sleep?
It is no use, said a voice.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Oh let me in.
What age is he?
How is that done?
It might have done me good.
Oh, you are there.
You can hear that, miss?
You must stay with me.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Do you have my note?
Her voice was low.
All was dark.
Which box do you mean?
This made him wonder more and more.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Wait for me.
Do you talk in your sleep?
It stood behind the door.
If only they would be quick.
She got her hand free.
Get to bed.
Yes, all right.
It was cold and dark.
Then it is certain?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
And yet you are the better off?
She heard and saw nothing.
Sit down, he said.
They know nothing about it.
It is his voice.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Good to rest once in a way.
Yes and no.
He must be in the same boat as us.
It is time for bed.
The water ran dry.
All that for nothing?
The night was very dark.
Is he in bed?
What has brought you here?
It was right in front of us.
Oh, just listen.
But what then must be done?
You can sleep here.
Wonder is it like that.
You know you must say yes.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
He saw nothing.
You must stay.
He was here a minute ago.
is it come yet?
Play the game out.
The snow is deep.
It has to be done.
You are free to do so.
Be back in a minute.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Then all was dark again.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Fly, my friend.
Are you strong?
He ran up to them.
You could see there was a story behind it.
A fine thing too.
Never mind that.
Will you rest here a little?
Nothing had come of it.
What have they done?
Take good note of it.
How long ago?
Is my father in town?
Come quick.
Yes, once.
Let me see your plan.
Oh, come now.
Oh, this is too much.
What have you done?
Yes, very well.
That is a fact.
What have they done with my work?
Then lead the way.
What did the letter contain?
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Try to sleep.
This is a test.
Come, and we can rest together.
You knew it, and said nothing?
It was a long time before she could sleep.
There is your old bed.
My mind is made up.
Yes, and no.
Of course she will.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Just let us go free.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Now we must wait.
What a game.
Yes, to be sure.
Wait a minute.
