Watch over him.
We should ask him.
Then, good night.
Write an answer.
Let me hear your story.
Let us go in.
What did he answer?
Dont say that to me.
What was the name of the man who took it?
To the left.
You should take me there one day.
It is open?
For once you are right.
What did he say in the letter?
How many children?
Is that far?
Where is this city?
These were the first people we saw.
And now let us go home.
And this food?
Let him follow me.
Good for the country.
Good night, friend.
Let us go back.
Who let you in?
He has children of his own.
Then let me have a word with you.
Well, read the letter again.
And what did you do with that letter?
That night we were just in time.
What was left of him?
At four, she said.
You must walk.
What is life to you?
You must never tell.
First turn to the left.
Who found them out?
You might want it.
This is what began it all.
It was like new life to him.
You must eat now.
Who said four?
How could you let him go so far?
She must have a hard time with him.
It might help.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
She saw it.
Just a few.
It was white.
Do you want to cross?
Let me go to the door.
Now or never.
Stop and think.
Here is the book.
How much have you got?
When did you begin?
Take care.
But it would be in the paper.
He has been been found.
Give me the letter.
Why dont you play?
Who should it be?
Have you found it?
Have you been at sea?
Off with her head.
Let me get on with my work.
There was no answer.
And why should they?
No, that can never be.
They are hard at it.
He is my friend.
Look at his face.
Are we late?
Dont you want any?
Think of my father.
Ask one of those men.
Dont tell me.
Who can answer for that?
Did you see his eye?
Now let me have it.
Sure of what?
You are sure of it?
Watch him, he said.
It was the last day of the year.
Come at once.
We must begin again.
The children will live just the same.
Few had found it.
It would seem so.
Come, let us be men.
Are we too late?
In the country?
We are together.
He had only one night more to live.
Tell me more.
He then said, It is time to start.
It is always so.
Why, it was one of his own men.
Who took him out of it?
Does he never go out?
Do you often come back?
Have you got it?
What do you think of the music?
It is a long story.
Take care of him.
Let me be and let me live.
Right here it began.
Let me get to work.
And he left the room.
It is so very kind of you both.
What should he say?
How could you begin?
Why should this be so?
But let us walk.
We found it.
Is he a real father?
She came over last night.
They always know.
He came at once.
And she left the room.
My father is right.
Tell her to begin.
It was then time to start.
Dont you see that?
Do you know how he made his mark?
We got one and they got one.
What did you hear?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Well, run back to her.
They may tell us to open it.
Who was the letter from?
Where have you been this long while?
Say good night.
No, never.
She might be at his house.
We dont see it like that.
How many are left?
Do you have a car?
No, stop.
One never has too much.
There was no letter for me.
But it is the same with any life.
He is always at it.
Keep to the left.
Dont you like it?
Who could have thought it?
Let me know at once when you will start.
It will be too late.
Music is a good thing.
He saw his men draw back.
But hard to tell.
Off with his head.
Both of us.
Our own people must come first.
We should look at this.
We may be too late.
Who did you learn that from?
Stop, let me show you the way.
No, why should he?
He may come close.
You are right, father.
Let them have it.
She never came back.
Are you sure?
Have you got that?
Why do you stop here?
There, do you hear?
What do you hear?
what river is it?
But they may still come here.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Tell us a story.
And your children?
Now you must eat.
Come over in the sun.
Let him answer us.
Open the door.
Why is he cross with me?
Why, is it late?
This is real.
He could run no more.
There were few near me.
So it always was.
Call the next one.
Come let us see them.
He is my father.
A second man got up and went out.
Let me see her.
We got to let that go.
Only, dont look back.
Let me look.
Was you in my room?
And what did you learn from him?
Keep to the right.
And then we may begin.
But then it will be too late.
It was his own room.
We got under way at last.
A call for help, you thought?
Let me have a word with you.
Can you hear me?
Why, dont you hear it?
Let me see him at once.
We might learn a thing or two.
She is my friend.
She saw no one?
If you know, why dont you tell?
At last we have a man.
But what did you hear?
She is still here?
Let me in.
Is it in the city?
And then they began to fish.
Where has she run off to?
Here he is at last.
Always the same with you people.
It was the first thing he thought of.
You are sure of that?
But you must never tell.
Are you my friend?
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Life is all right.
He said at last.
Where is the river?
it took all that time to come over the water.
She got up.
Can you stand?
So take care of me.
Let me see it.
And now, good night.
But take care.
She came in just now by the back door.
And who is this friend?
Why dont you want to go?
Just cut it out, will you?
Come here, my friend.
Dont you think so?
You took it.
Let me see him.
We were together.
What country does he come from?
Any book will tell you that.
But it is all all too late now.
Go to your father.
There is only food for one.
We are very far from that.
But you got to play music for them.
Is there any answer?
There are only four of us.
At this time of my life, no.
But watch over him.
Let me out.
Let me hear what it is.
Well, let us be sure of that.
There to the left.
So, once more, good night.
Stop, said he.
Cut your hand open?
One was on a white horse.
Have you never been there?
He might still be up.
He is at sea.
This took him some time.
Let us cross over.
It was very hard.
Point it at his horse.
No, said the Tree.
Good night again.
What do you think when you hear music?
No, dont.
Why should they?
Well, what next?
Still, you never know.
Do you know where he is?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
You saw him?
You got me?
But she saw no one?
Let us start, then.
We must go at once.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
That was the first night.
Do you know what he did last night?
They are always the same.
Keep watch all night.
They dont care.
What a night it has been.
Which end is his head?
How did it begin?
So they got out and went in.
Do you hear me?
And there are four of you?
Here is the paper.
One night more and he would be on his way.
What was it that you thought?
He had two left feet.
But are you sure of that?
Which story was it?
Will you never learn?
This is my country.
One of us will be here all night.
It is well thought of.
Cut him down.
Do you want some more to eat?
Let me say one thing.
Never see him again.
Let him grow up with you.
They never come back.
So he began to help.
They came over last night.
Let her go.
But it was very late.
The other night she left.
Here we see the boy at school.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
It is from your father.
How would they stop it?
Where could you keep it?
Let me go back.
Do we stop here?
We never thought of that.
What a start that was.
But then you would be close to the sea?
Always the same, year after year.
It is music.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
You have a car?
They never did it again.
No, said her father.
You found him?
Are you sure of it?
Is my father here?
Here is the letter.
What is your real name?
Is it far?
They dont know their own country.
Do you have the letter?
But now it is too late.
Dont move, he said.
Come eat with me.
The sun had set long since.
What would you have me do with my life?
It must be in her own house.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
But why dont you want to take it?
By and by he got it.
Do you hear that?
You must study.
That is the idea.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Just cut it out.
See him grow up.
You will answer for it.
