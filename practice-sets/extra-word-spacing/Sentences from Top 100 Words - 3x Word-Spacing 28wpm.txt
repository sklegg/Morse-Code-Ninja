When is it?
How would you like to have it?
and so on, and so on.
There were two of them.
Did you see her?
How is he now?
Do you know?
Can one see from there?
What are we to do?
And how did you find out?
What was it about?
Can you do that?
Did you know them?
You can go.
Or so they said.
And has it come to this?
And who is this?
but what if it is?
How did you come by it?
She has it.
There they are.
At what number?
Then who are you?
We have no water.
Do you know him?
That is what she did.
There he is, she said.
There he is, you see.
Is that all?
What other way is there to look at it?
What do you see?
but there was more to it than this.
That will do, said he.
Look over it.
And what is that?
But it was of no use.
And is that all?
But WHAT DID you see?
Do you know what you look like?
What do they call you?
Will that do?
Look at them.
You know more than we do.
The time had come.
How was that?
Do you know what it is?
How are you?
But what have they been up to?
And what do you make of it?
How did he do it?
You may go.
When was it?
who, then, are you?
You can have some.
You know how it is with her.
But what will you do?
One or two?
But how about you?
What did you do then?
That will do, he said.
Look at it.
How is she?
But so it is.
What is there to see?
We have him.
what has she to do with it?
There is but one thing to do.
Would you like some?
Then, how do you know?
And all for what?
What is it for?
Do you like him?
And who are you?
Look at him.
And what do you call her?
What is it all about?
How is he?
Is it over?
Then how many are there?
What are you up to?
That is a long time.
What is he like?
May we come in?
But he had no time.
How did you know about it?
But he had to have it.
There you are, he said.
No was there one?
What did he do to you?
But who was she?
And what did you see?
Do you see him?
That was it.
what is it?
What do you make of it?
Had to look the other way.
Is that her?
But it has been so long.
How do you do?
You have them?
Do you see it?
Who will go first?
What is all this?
That was all she said.
And do you like him?
So it is.
Is it like him?
Has it come to this?
Did you see it?
But will he see it?
What DO you know of him?
Is she like him?
Do you know her?
Now what are we to do with you?
And when will you call?
Who is she?
Do as you like.
But what are you up to?
How can it be?
The time will come.
And do you like her?
How long has he been there?
Now is your time.
What do you make of that?
He said no.
Did you know him?
Call him in.
Come this way.
Who and what are you?
So there it was.
But when will that be?
who can it be?
So that was the way.
Is that it?
Look at it this way.
What have you come for?
Did you know her?
But what is it?
You have it.
What is it about?
There he is, do you see him?
What can this be?
Then there is more to do.
Do as you will.
Then what is it?
When was that?
Who was he?
What could it be?
Then make it up.
There you are.
Is he there?
What is it like?
At what time?
How did she do it?
Can it be?
No one will come, she said.
And what did you do then?
What was he like?
but we can go and see.
So be it.
are you there?
Now there is no more to be said.
And who was that?
Go on, he said.
It was from you.
Is it time?
Tqhen you may go.
So it was.
And what was it for?
What can we do, then?
What is that?
Who was that?
What was it?
Will you come and see her?
Out of the way.
Now you know.
Then what are you up to now?
You can do it.
How can you know?
What will you do, then?
Would you do what he did?
They said no more.
What would she have said?
Are you there?
What time is it?
Do they know him?
And could she see him?
What did they do?
Which is it?
Who are you?
But how is that?
And what was it for?
You can have some.
What was it about?
And what do you make of it?
But what have they been up to?
You can go.
You may go.
But so it is.
Who and what are you?
But how about you?
It was from you.
There is but one thing to do.
You have them?
Who will go first?
Then what is it?
And who are you?
That is what she did.
Call him in.
But WHAT DID you see?
And is that all?
And who is this?
But what is it?
The time had come.
So it is.
Then make it up.
How is she?
who can it be?
Look at it this way.
Then there is more to do.
What other way is there to look at it?
How would you like to have it?
There he is, she said.
What have you come for?
And what do you call her?
Can one see from there?
That was it.
What do you make of that?
Is it like him?
And do you like her?
Now is your time.
But what will you do?
Now you know.
Do you know him?
Tqhen you may go.
So that was the way.
Would you like some?
Who is she?
And what did you see?
Is it time?
She has it.
How did you come by it?
Is that all?
Has it come to this?
What is it like?
Or so they said.
He said no.
There he is, you see.
And what did you do then?
What is it about?
Do as you will.
Is it over?
and so on, and so on.
At what time?
Are you there?
May we come in?
Can you do that?
There were two of them.
What DO you know of him?
What is it for?
And how did you find out?
Do they know him?
What did they do?
There he is, do you see him?
but what if it is?
Do you see him?
Now what are we to do with you?
Look over it.
And all for what?
No one will come, she said.
That was all she said.
So there it was.
What is it all about?
What was he like?
Will that do?
That will do, said he.
Will you come and see her?
Did you know her?
Come this way.
How long has he been there?
What did he do to you?
What did you do then?
Do you know?
Which is it?
What could it be?
Then who are you?
How is he?

What do you see?
How did you know about it?
Is she like him?
How did he do it?
How can it be?
Do you know her?
What is he like?
You know more than we do.
Then, how do you know?
And has it come to this?
You can do it.
When was that?
There they are.
