Then what is it?
Out of the way.
Look at them.
Do you see it?
There were two of them.
And do you like her?
She has it.
Do you know what you look like?
So that was the way.
But how is that?
Look at it this way.
But what have they been up to?
There he is, you see.
Would you do what he did?
No was there one?
Can you do that?
What time is it?
Is that it?
And could she see him?
Is it time?
Do you know him?
The time will come.
And when will you call?
Who are you?
But what is it?
You can go.
Is it like him?
One or two?
You have it.
Is he there?
What did he do to you?
And is that all?
That was it.
What are you up to?
Did you know them?
Had to look the other way.
Look over it.
So be it.
Did you see her?
Who was that?
Did you know her?
What is there to see?
But when will that be?
What will you do, then?
Do you know what it is?
But what are you up to?
When was it?
Then how many are there?
Did you know him?
and so on, and so on.
Is she like him?
That will do, he said.
And who are you?
And what did you see?
You know how it is with her.
And what was it for?
What was he like?
And what is that?
But how about you?
Tqhen you may go.
who, then, are you?
What was it about?
who can it be?
At what number?
And what did you do then?
What have you come for?
He said no.
Did you see it?
At what time?
Is that her?
That will do, said he.
How are you?
but there was more to it than this.
What other way is there to look at it?
There he is, do you see him?
There he is, she said.
But he had no time.
Who will go first?
You have them?
Then make it up.
What is all this?
What would she have said?
Who and what are you?
Do as you will.
Can one see from there?
We have him.
Do they know him?
What can this be?
But he had to have it.
but we can go and see.
what has she to do with it?
And all for what?
What did you do then?
But what will you do?
What did they do?
Which is it?
Call him in.
How did you know about it?
That is a long time.
Then who are you?
How is he now?
How do you do?
There you are.
what is it?
Now what are we to do with you?
The time had come.
May we come in?
What could it be?
There they are.
There is but one thing to do.
Come this way.
What do you make of it?
How did you come by it?
Who was he?
But so it is.
But it was of no use.
And has it come to this?
And how did you find out?
How can it be?
How was that?
So there it was.
And do you like him?
How would you like to have it?
Can it be?
And what do you call her?
Will you come and see her?
There you are, he said.
What do they call you?
So it is.
Now there is no more to be said.
How long has he been there?
What is it all about?
You may go.
Is it over?
What is he like?
Or so they said.
How did he do it?
Now you know.
Will that do?
How can you know?
Go on, he said.
How is she?
What is it for?
What is it like?
Do you know her?
Would you like some?
What is it about?
Look at it.
No one will come, she said.
But will he see it?
It was from you.
are you there?
When is it?
You can do it.
Then there is more to do.
What DO you know of him?
Then, how do you know?
Do as you like.
Do you like him?
And who is this?
How did she do it?
Are you there?
But it has been so long.
That is what she did.
You can have some.
When was that?
But WHAT DID you see?
You know more than we do.
Who is she?
What was it?
So it was.
And what do you make of it?
And who was that?
But who was she?
Then what are you up to now?
That was all she said.
Look at him.
What is that?
What can we do, then?
What do you see?
Now is your time.
What do you make of that?
They said no more.
How is he?
We have no water.
What are we to do?
Is that all?
Has it come to this?
but what if it is?
Do you see him?
Do you know?
It was from you.
So it is.
So be it.
What was it?
And has it come to this?
Then make it up.
But what have they been up to?
Do you know her?
May we come in?
Who is she?
Do you see it?
What time is it?
Is it like him?
Is it over?
How did she do it?
How is he?

Now what are we to do with you?
What are we to do?
Did you see her?
Out of the way.
Then what are you up to now?
And what is that?
So it was.
No one will come, she said.
What could it be?
Can it be?
What is all this?
What do you make of it?
Do they know him?
Who was that?
You have it.
But what are you up to?
What did you do then?
What was it about?
And what did you see?
Look at them.

But who was she?
Is it time?
Is that it?
There they are.
At what time?
How can you know?
How is he now?
Had to look the other way.
who can it be?
Did you see it?
How is she?
Do you know what it is?
Now is your time.
What did he do to you?
There he is, do you see him?
That was it.
Who and what are you?
And what do you call her?
And when will you call?
But what is it?
Look at him.
Will that do?
Is that her?
What is it about?
There you are, he said.
And do you like her?
What can this be?
When was that?
You may go.
Then, how do you know?
What can we do, then?
Can one see from there?
What do they call you?
What DO you know of him?
but what if it is?
And how did you find out?
How can it be?
