The night was cold and still.
You are right, young man.
What have you against me now?
Are you ready to play?
Are you still cold?
Do you own a dog?
The world is big enough.
In an hour it will be at the door.
What is love?
Now, listen.
She knew at once.
Half as many is too much.
Better late than never.
Does she go fast?
It was all she could do to hold in.
Let us leave them, she said.
Leave off that.
Listen to them, he said.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
And serve them right.
You will soon know.
They had much to talk about.
So the question was, what to do?
We had a list.
On fire, on fire.
Long and the short of it.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Listen to this, will you?
It is a fire.
It would have been more simple.
I have no children to love me.
She was a good girl.
She had very little notice from him.
Do you remember him?
She was only a little girl.
And that is the whole point.
Did they ever go back?
No, my love.
She was so young, too.
You love him?
Listen to him.
Where are you off to so early?
Pull it more to your side.
Before you leave, tell us.
It would be better if you went to the war.
This is my body.
You know me well enough.
If you know it, that is enough.
No more money?
Against what side?
Have you heard from him often?
Ask them to sing one more song.
It is true.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Now listen to me.
What kind of a bird?
But one day you must feel it.
Is your family well?
Did you get any money?
She knew what was good for children.
How far from the body?
They told me to.
You are cold.
A young man?
That is enough.
She must be told.
Better cross here.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Let that pass.
He never told us what it was she said.
It will interest you, said he.
That is true.
Was he young or old?
Long live the king.
You may go, said the King.
Are they made to order?
How did this happen?
who told you you could?
In an hour?
To know her is to love her.
Who was it told me his name?
Will you answer that question?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Are we ready?
We took our leave early, and left together.
But he never heard me.
You have an hour.
She is very plain.
But why must you leave me so soon?
Then what would happen?
But she is very young.
Can she sing?
Can you sing?
Let this man pass.
Well, young man?
Do you remember?
He is very simple.
Do you love her much?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Then get ready at once.
A house is on fire?
From then on it was war between them.
Is your man white or black?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
You must leave that to me.
We will talk about that.
We got her half way.
We are ready.
Which king?
That would be the best way.
You can pass through the door.
It was true to life.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Fire and water, earth and air.
The dog is always with him.
Answer me this one question.
So do you, my love.
An example would be better.
Do you love me?
No less, no more.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
Remember that time?
She told me to ask you.
Let us pass.
How many children did he leave?
An hour and a half.
What size do you want?
It is a young girl.
You must travel.
That was the question.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
Are you in love with her?
Young man, you will go far.
She is the first person in this house.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
But listen to me.
Hold it up to the light.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
You will always love him?
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Let us talk about you.
Keep in step.
Ten will be early enough.
Leave any for him?
And dont talk to me.
Why do we love?
Look to the west.
This was true.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
When did this happen?
No, he is a man about my size.
Take good care of the little girl.
Who told you so?
When do you leave?
Do you know that old lay?
Has she any family?
Listen to me.
He said, the work is now complete.
you know better than that.
How does it feel?
Your true father?
And what does she want the money for?
Let me see him, said the young man.
He said, get him out of the road.
Have you heard?
Why do you serve?
That was the rule, she said.
We knew them both.
About the usual time.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
They had several children.
Let me hear from you soon.
Then you will know me better.
And so they began to talk.
Let me remember what he said.
He put his hand over part of the map.
And will you direct us?
It has been there ever since.
Let me also ask you a question.
Did you tell him your whole story?
He had enough of it.
Leave me out of the question.
Take notice.
Let us talk a little about my father.
And so they knew that it was true.
You are right, my love.
They can have all our half of the house.
Is the wind north or south?
Never heard of it before.
We serve them.
You are in love with me?
Five young children.
Is it true?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
We had better go in.
They all heard me.
They are still young.
The King Went to him.
But let that pass.
The rock was very small.
That may be true.
Read them, said the King.
This is simple.
It was true.
He will leave me.
You are better than that.
what could be better?
We dont know enough.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Never heard of it.
Little girl, where have you been?
Better write it here.
Pull together.
Why do they want to make her sing?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
You remember the place, my father?
You may leave the room.
So we came down this road.
Take a hold of it.
But what did we ever get for it?
That must be true.
She is fast?
He knew them.
Did he though?
Are you all ready?
you must step out.
We were up early.
She is much better.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
What does he feel?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
You are a good girl.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Can it be true?
It is a rock.
Ten, did you say?
What have you heard?
It is cold.
And you can sing?
We must make the best of it.
It was a round table.
Is that true?
And how did he make his money?
And then he told all he knew.
Well, are you ready?
What will happen now?
How do you feel now?
How could that happen?
What a question.
How short his time.
Hold her hand.
He had my love.
What do you mean by that question?
And you are still so young.
One other question, said he.
You were told.
There was no wind.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Put down three and carry five.
It is the rule.
It can never happen.
Do you remember me?
Had they been heard?
Feel better then.
Why talk to me?
Had you heard?
What is there to talk about?
Does he love you?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Pass this way, then.
Are you ready?
You are on a ship?
You saw the person?
But enough of this.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
That is enough for me.
What a state he was in.
In short, take me.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
Where did they get the money from?
If you only knew.
Never heard of him.
They knew it.
Much of it was true.
How does this happen?
Are you better?
Your watch is slow.
Light my fire.
Do you want any money?
What will happen to us?
But how simple it is.
This will pass in no time.
You had better go.
She told me all about it.
He got it this morning.
you should know her better than me.
Where he was, no one knew.
They had heard all that before.
Why did it happen?
Try it on the dog first.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
It was cold.
Have you told her?
How do you feel?
There are four hundred?
He has money.
This money was for her.
A better man than you.
Have you a family?
We call it black.
That is very simple.
Who told you that?
Are you here on leave?
But listen to this, he said.
Every word you said was heard.
How soon will he be here?
And why do you serve?
And you will always love him?
What can happen?
The family was at home.
As soon as you left, it began.
They left in the morning.
He never heard.
He is better than any of you.
Half a mile?
Made me feel so young.
The night was cold.
