Then bring them to me, she said.
Of course it might.
Why, of course.
Oh, do you know?
We must be quick.
But let us see your plan.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
But wait a minute.
But it must be done soon.
Yes, it is true.
She gave me her hand.
Then it is certain?
Wait a second.
Wait for me.
And then the game began all over again.
Of course she will.
Perhaps he did.
Your voice is that of a young man.
How was that possible?
Nothing she can eat?
It was a cold, dark night.
Yes, to be sure.
A fine thing too.
It was a warm night.
You must stay.
Clear my name.
Yes, once.
There is no possible way.
Just let us go free.
What have they done?
The island was a mile long.
He ran up to them.
Here is our plan.
Will you rest here a little?
Clear the way.
It must be done at once.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Very well, wait a minute.
Well, what does that lead up to?
It must be done.
What is power?
Yes, sit down.
You are in my power.
Look at that dark water.
Why did you bring him here?
It stood behind the door.
Come quick.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Yes, go on.
But how long ago?
She heard and saw nothing.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Wonder is it like that.
Fly, my friend.
But they could see nothing.
Help me sit up.
There is no one in that room behind you.
All right then, sit down.
Well, of course.
That is possible.
How long would you keep me in town?
And yet you said he had money.
You must have a rest.
What kind of voice is it?
We are more strong together.
Yes, that is true.
They would cry.
Answer me that, miss.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
No, nothing at all.
She could think of nothing more to say.
This made him wonder more and more.
It was brought to me.
What has brought you here?
Come, let me show you my plan.
Is it certain?
Oh, do as you like.
Did she fall?
Let us sit down.
He saw nothing.
It was so very long ago.
Who gave it to you?
and so he decide he go back home.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
How can a little dog laugh?
Oh, tell me.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
In that town there is a street.
Nothing could be more simple.
They all fall to the ground.
Like these in shape and size?
Oh, come now.
Let me see your plan.
His plan is very simple.
Did he fall?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
He is in the box.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
If only they would be quick.
Yes and no.
It was very dark.
What age is he?
It was so long ago.
Do you see that island?
Is it possible?
And what a voice she has.
Are they on foot?
Stay where you are.
It is very clear.
Oh, take those off.
Now we must wait.
But she is nothing to me now.
Oh, if men only knew.
They know nothing about it.
Good to rest once in a way.
Money is no object?
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
She began to cry.
He will sleep an hour.
And he told you nothing?
Of course it is.
Well then, be quick.
I hear his voice in the house.
You better stay here all night.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
It was cold and dark.
Take good note of it.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
All of this was possible.
Bring this with you.
Yes, my love?
It is a real bed.
Nothing had come of it.
Oh, that is very simple.
Yes, he said.
It is all done.
Yes, we know that.
Is that a fact?
There, by the wheel.
Free to do what?
Oh, man.
Oh, dont ask me.
It was a very dark night.
Better sit still.
He must be in the same boat as us.
Behind my bed.
Do you talk in your sleep?
At his side was a large green box.
Is my father in town?
He brought it with him for us to see.
The old man gave no answer.
That was well done.
There is a lot of people.
Yes, it did.
You are free to do so.
This is a test.
Yes, and no.
Let him go free?
You will fall.
Wait a minute.
What have you done?
He must wait.
All was dark.
Go back to bed.
He began to laugh.
Oh, go on.
Oh let me in.
She got her hand free.
Keep clear of him.
Nothing new under the sun.
Oh, nothing.
There was more to be done.
What can be done?
It might have done me good.
Well, what about my plan?
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Wait and see.
Laugh, if you will.
It was hot.
It is time for bed.
It was full of people.
He had made up his mind.
Her voice was low.
Oh, very well, he said.
She was still game.
Sit down, he said.
You know nothing about it.
Oh, but you were there?
Yes, she said.
It was a kind of language between us.
Never mind how he came here.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Just go to sleep.
Is that possible?
Sit down, said the old man.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Oh, to be sure.
Yes, what is it?
It was right in front of us.
You knew it, and said nothing?
We brought them in.
Play the game out.
People might know my voice and find me out.
He left long ago.
Well, sit down by me.
What did the letter contain?
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Oh, all right.
Yes, he did.
Yes, there it is.
It is no use, said a voice.
Leave the rest to me.
Yes, that was a picture book.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Yes, go and find out.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Oh, take me with you.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
You know you must say yes.
My mind was soon made up.
What is done is done.
Clear the table.
You can sleep here.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
That is a fact.
And here is the note.
And you can do nothing until then?
Is he in bed?
Where can you wait for me?
Bring them here.
Oh, of course.
Well, sit down.
The night was very dark.
Yes, she could sing that.
Then he must be a wonder.
Never mind me.
He has a good voice still.
The city was soon behind me.
But that is nothing to us.
Come, and we can rest together.
He was here a minute ago.
There is nothing more to be said.
Then lead the way.
The night was dark.
It is possible.
He gave me this paper.
He stood up.
It is nothing.
Oh, he is so kind.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
is it come yet?
It was a dark night.
It is done.
Go in there and drive them out.
Oh, that.
There is your old bed.
You brought no one with you?
His will be done.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Yes, you are right.
It is his voice.
Nothing is more simple.
They call him a fine boy.
Well yes, you are right.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
It was done.
The whole day had been hot.
Well, miss?
How long ago?
Why should my father fly?
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
It was a record run.
He never said nothing.
The snow is deep.
Bring it here.
This voice was that of my father.
Never mind that.
Yes, of course.
What brought you here?
Why does the boat go so fast?
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Be back in a minute.
Oh, no.
But never mind that.
But what then must be done?
Hold on a minute.
My mind is made up.
Then all was dark again.
Get to bed.
Wonder what he does.
Quick, friend, quick.
But what must be done?
Did it all rest on me?
If you fall dont wait to get up.
What more is to be done?
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Lead me to him.
How is that done?
They need a rest.
Oh, how can you sleep?
See what you have done.
Be quick, for the time is short.
How was it done?
Oh, do the best you can.
Dont laugh.
Yes, said the old man.
Yes, all right.
Of course he was right.
Money is power.
In a minute.
Half the town was there.
And sit in the dark?
Oh, just listen.
That would be a fine thing.
Yes, she was back.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Oh, this is too much.
Do you have my note?
Are you strong?
Can it be possible?
Yes, he said, all of it.
Yes, very well.
Did she stay long?
Try to sleep.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
What has he done?
You can hear that, miss?
And yet you are the better off?
Decide if you are going back home.
He is among us.
Behind every book is a man.
All that for nothing?
He knew nothing.
Nothing at all.
Yes, but what did she say?
You love a certain person.
No, nothing of the kind.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Nothing could have been better.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Fine, very fine.
You must stay with me.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Oh, you are there.
Wonder if he has a name.
Which box do you mean?
We are free to act and think.
Who brought you up?
Of course they will.
The water ran dry.
His first cry was for his father.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Let her wait.
What a game.
And what have you done to me?
What have they done with my work?
It has to be done.
It is certain.
Go and rest.
Again came the voice.
Well, there he stood.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
He had, to be sure, done much.
