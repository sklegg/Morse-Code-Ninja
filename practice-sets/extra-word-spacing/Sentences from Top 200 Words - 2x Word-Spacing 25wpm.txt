Well then, what do you want?
What does it all mean?
Such as what?
Do you think she was?
Say no more about it.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Where are we to turn for help?
Can you take me?
What a good thing it would be.
Turn this way.
Is it any good?
Tell us all about it.
Is it as good now?
You must take me with you.
Here it is.
Follow me, said the man.
Where in the world did you come from?
And where is it?
Now, what do you want with me?
Were you here before me?
Where is he now?
What is that in your hand?
How can you think of such a thing?
He was there too.
Now come here.
They want more.
Why do you want to know?
You are most kind.
What does all this mean?
Give me my work.
I would like to see her again in that.
He was at work again.
They are here.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
That is the end of her.
And how old were you at that time?
But he is right.
Where do they get that?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Will you come with me?
Give me your hand.
All right, then.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Now tell me.
That is just my point.
Give me a light.
He went on his way.
She had to tell him.
And what about your mother?
He said that that would help.
Well, tell me.
It will take a little time.
Why is he here?
You must come now.
Get out and play.
We are who we say we are.
Why are you here?
You know, you see right through people.
Move on, then.
You can help me here.
Is this the man?
There she is again.
What is his name?
She has been with him many long years.
Well, all right.
It is all the same.
There is more to tell.
Would you now like to look round my place?
Go and try.
How do you take it?
He went to him.
How can you say that?
But what did you want?
You are right.
But you must.
Come with me.
See, they are here.
Where do you live?
You must tell me.
Come and help me.
Is that all you want?
Come with me, then.
There was no one near.
One, two, three.
Why, what is it, then?
And what was his name?
Say no more.
But who was your mother?
How much do you want?
Get to work.
What do you think of that?
What did he tell you?
Well, here he is.
But why do you ask?
And do you know why?
Here is my hand.
What do you mean by that?
Time to get out.
It is the same thing.
He has more to give.
What could she mean by it?
Where have they been?
Tell us your name.
How much are they?
Why do you want water?
You are all very kind to me.
Take this and this.
Why are you like this?
Where to, now?
Well, go on.
Good day to you.
What is your name?
And that was the end of it.
Do you know me?
That was a house to look at.
You think so?
We will say no more about it, then.
Do it for me.
But where is it?
Very well, he said.
There is no one here to see.
Play with them.
There was work to do.
That would be very good.
And where was the place?
She was the cause of it all.
No, tell me.
take them all.
When will it take place?
Can you help me find my way?
Show me the way.
For how much?
Here it is, he said.
Only two there now.
For some man.
Have you been here long?
Show it to me.
There is no place like home.
Ask him to show up?
After three, he said.
You will get on in the world.
Large or small?
Well, what do you think about it?
Tell me about it.
Where are they off to now?
That was a good time.
This is my point.
He is at my house.
And what do you think?
What do you want?
To what end?
Then what kind is it?
How can you tell?
You can say what it is.
Ask her, he said.
Is he big?
All in good time.
What does she want?
It is very high.
But it is just so with the world.
Give it to me, then.
What more could a man ask for?
He will live.
Very well, show him to me.
Who are these men?
How did you get me out?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Three, he said.
What did he say?
It is very kind of you.
Tell me his name.
Now, go home.
And it did me good.
Read that, he said.
Where is he?
And where is he now?
Then they will follow you?
He will ask for it.
Can you point it out to me?
But what does it mean?
How did you get here?
Give it me.
And what did he say?
Show me the way he went.
What did you say your name was?
But he does so need a mother.
do you come from the end of the world?
How does she use you?
Where did you place it?
there are only two.
Now we see the light.
You are a good boy.
Well then, tell him so.
What do they want?
Too much in the way.
What do you play?
Show us where you live, said the man.
When will he come back?
They had all been very good to us.
This is the first act.
What on earth does this mean?
Look at me.
And a very good thing, too.
What will each of you give?
You see it every day.
Where is she?
We must come back.
This for me?
Where did he come from?
She was right.
What have you been after?
Is it you or me?
Read that, she said.
But where is he?
He said too much.
How did that help you?
Is it all right?
This is the man.
And who is the man?
There is the little boy.
Where are you?
It is great.
What you have just said is good, very good.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Tell me all about it.
What do you want to ask these people?
Well, read it.
How on earth do you know?
Is he a good man?
What was his name?
Who will tell her?
If you want to know, go and find out.
He was so kind.
Where have you been?
Some day you may ask me about it.
Will you take me to her?
Where are you from?
Think of him.
where did she come from?
What did you say that for?
Too much for me now.
No, mother.
Why, what do you mean?
What was it you said to me?
And how did you find out?
Think it over.
Look at it other way round.
Then will come our time.
Say what you want.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Very well then.
How can you find out?
And what are they made of?
There, that does me good.
What would you have me do?
She came up to them.
But what about me?
That is all one can say about her.
Here is the way we put in the time.
Just look at her.
Are you here for good?
Now, you know me.
Then why are you here?
We are here.
Did you tell him?
How old are you?
How could she say such a thing.
Which house is it?
Just look through it.
Well, and is that all?
Here she is.
Are they like each other?
And off we go.
She has a house?
And have you been here long?
Much good that would be.
Are you back again?
Too much of this.
Tell me who made the world.
Just like me.
Well, how did it go?
How does he use it?
Put it on.
Is there some for me?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
In what year?
Why are they here?
What do you think of him?
Do you want me to do it?
What do you want me to do?
How old was she?
What will you say?
Will you try?
What does one live for?
Do you think so now?
Do you think so?
It was now his turn to look about him.
What do you think of her?
But this is the point.
There will just be time.
And they went home.
She went on.
But where are we to go?
See, here it is.
What is in your hand?
That is right.
Call me what you will, he said.
You were near him.
Why is that?
Where could he be?
Think no more about that.
What on earth do you mean?
Give him air.
How long have you been here?
Well, what do you think?
And what will they do with us?
Is that right?
It was high time.
At your house?
Think what you will.
What do they say was the cause?
And in she went.
Take some, she said.
Why did he come?
Well, how are you?
Give me more than that
And how in the world did you find them?
What does he mean?
He was here.
Where does he live?
Been back long?
Good day, one and all.
And where is this man?
What could set you off in the first place?
Now where did they come from?
Who is that man?
That was very good.
Well, and what do you think?
Is she well?
The first act was over.
What do you think of this?
Get out of the way.
What does she think about me?
And why is that?
Where are you off to?
Now it was time to act.
Try it on.
this one, too?
Is it large?
And what did she say?
Good, he said.
And what is her name?
That is right, said the old man.
The world is before you.
When will her mother come?
Is there no one who can help me?
And where is she, then?
In what part of the house?
Come with me to the little house.
You think so, too?
Are you at it again?
What do you mean?
Well, did he?
But why do you ask me?
It must be where you put it.
Hand it in.
Where are we?
It would be very kind of you.
