And you can do nothing until then?
Yes, but what did she say?
The whole night the tree stood still.
They need a rest.
There is no possible way.
Oh, go on.
You are in my power.
You must stay with me.
She was still game.
What a game.
It was a warm night.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
My mind was soon made up.
He ran up to them.
Clear the way.
Go in there and drive them out.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Get to bed.
But never mind that.
Fine, very fine.
Let her wait.
You must have a rest.
Nothing at all.
Well, what does that lead up to?
What have they done with my work?
You can hear that, miss?
Play the game out.
Fly, my friend.
How was it done?
is it come yet?
Oh, how can you sleep?
Be back in a minute.
Then all was dark again.
She could think of nothing more to say.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
There is nothing more to be said.
Nothing is more simple.
Yes, all right.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Oh, dont ask me.
Yes, she said.
Yes, he did.
In a minute.
The island was a mile long.
Wonder if he has a name.
Look at that dark water.
That was well done.
Bring them here.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Let us sit down.
They all fall to the ground.
Quick, friend, quick.
He gave me this paper.
How long ago?
He is among us.
Well, miss?
People might know my voice and find me out.
Like these in shape and size?
Oh, come now.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Yes, once.
It was a cold, dark night.
Is he in bed?
Who gave it to you?
No, nothing of the kind.
Oh, do as you like.
Perhaps he did.
Why, of course.
Yes, it is true.
It was a dark night.
There is your old bed.
Who brought you up?
It is very clear.
Oh, he is so kind.
Yes, it did.
Go back to bed.
All of this was possible.
It was a record run.
Your voice is that of a young man.
It must be done.
Yes, you are right.
His plan is very simple.
It is his voice.
Try to sleep.
What kind of voice is it?
You will fall.
But what must be done?
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
In that town there is a street.
Yes, go on.
Yes, of course.
Nothing new under the sun.
Then lead the way.
Well, sit down by me.
The night was very dark.
What did the letter contain?
That would be a fine thing.
She gave me her hand.
It was a very dark night.
Of course they will.
It stood behind the door.
I hear his voice in the house.
Here is our plan.
It was done.
Free to do what?
What more is to be done?
You know nothing about it.
The snow is deep.
Yes, what is it?
Come, let me show you my plan.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Money is no object?
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Well, there he stood.
Oh, to be sure.
It was brought to me.
This is a test.
But how long ago?
Oh, very well, he said.
Yes, he said.
It was very dark.
And what have you done to me?
The old man gave no answer.
What have you done?
She heard and saw nothing.
You knew it, and said nothing?
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Wait a minute.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Oh, do the best you can.
What is power?
But wait a minute.
Do you have my note?
Oh, that is very simple.
He was here a minute ago.
What age is he?
Is it certain?
All that for nothing?
Did she stay long?
You better stay here all night.
Oh, tell me.
He must wait.
He never said nothing.
And here is the note.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
and so he decide he go back home.
That is a fact.
My mind is made up.
Of course it might.
Behind every book is a man.
It was so very long ago.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
But she is nothing to me now.
The night was dark.
Oh, do you know?
Never mind how he came here.
Nothing she can eat?
He has a good voice still.
Very well, wait a minute.
Just go to sleep.
It was so long ago.
He had, to be sure, done much.
There was more to be done.
Oh, of course.
He stood up.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
You must stay.
Oh, if men only knew.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
The city was soon behind me.
He is in the box.
Yes, go and find out.
And yet you said he had money.
The little boy lay in his bed.
It is no use, said a voice.
It is done.
He left long ago.
Did he fall?
Did she fall?
Let me see your plan.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Keep clear of him.
Wait and see.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Clear the table.
Her voice was low.
Just let us go free.
Which box do you mean?
Yes, said the old man.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Come, and we can rest together.
We are more strong together.
The water ran dry.
This made him wonder more and more.
He knew nothing.
Well, what about my plan?
They would cry.
It is nothing.
At his side was a large green box.
Well, of course.
He began to laugh.
How was that possible?
It is certain.
Leave the rest to me.
Go and rest.
Yes, and no.
But that is nothing to us.
Yes, that is true.
Are you strong?
What can be done?
No, nothing at all.
We must be quick.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Of course she will.
Why did you bring him here?
Oh, but you were there?
Why does the boat go so fast?
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
He will sleep an hour.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
You know you must say yes.
Never mind me.
Yes, very well.
It is a real bed.
Help me sit up.
Of course he was right.
Yes, she was back.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Lead me to him.
She began to cry.
He saw nothing.
Is my father in town?
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Oh, all right.
And what a voice she has.
Why should my father fly?
He had made up his mind.
That is possible.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Where can you wait for me?
Oh, man.
It was a kind of language between us.
Come quick.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Yes, sit down.
Nothing could have been better.
This voice was that of my father.
It is time for bed.
Is that possible?
Do you see that island?
Answer me that, miss.
His will be done.
What brought you here?
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
How is that done?
Half the town was there.
Behind my bed.
You are free to do so.
His first cry was for his father.
Yes, she could sing that.
Of course it is.
Laugh, if you will.
And sit in the dark?
He brought it with him for us to see.
A fine thing too.
Yes, my love?
It has to be done.
How long would you keep me in town?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Can it be possible?
Wait for me.
Better sit still.
But what then must be done?
It must be done at once.
Dont laugh.
And yet you are the better off?
We brought them in.
Bring it here.
It was right in front of us.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Oh, just listen.
What has he done?
All was dark.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
She got her hand free.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Clear my name.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Bring this with you.
You love a certain person.
There is a lot of people.
Wonder is it like that.
Stay where you are.
Oh, no.
The whole day had been hot.
Oh let me in.
Sit down, he said.
How can a little dog laugh?
Then he must be a wonder.
It might have done me good.
Oh, you are there.
Let him go free?
Yes, he said, all of it.
What has brought you here?
Now we must wait.
It is all done.
Decide if you are going back home.
Again came the voice.
Wonder what he does.
You can sleep here.
Yes, to be sure.
Take good note of it.
Yes, we know that.
They call him a fine boy.
Good to rest once in a way.
And then the game began all over again.
Will you rest here a little?
Wait a second.
Money is power.
But let us see your plan.
Nothing had come of it.
Oh, this is too much.
It was cold and dark.
Is it possible?
He must be in the same boat as us.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Never mind that.
What is done is done.
Oh, take those off.
There, by the wheel.
You brought no one with you?
It was hot.
Yes and no.
Then it is certain?
But it must be done soon.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Oh, nothing.
Oh, that.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Well then, be quick.
Did it all rest on me?
We are free to act and think.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Nothing could be more simple.
It is possible.
Are they on foot?
If only they would be quick.
Oh, take me with you.
Be quick, for the time is short.
See what you have done.
Sit down, said the old man.
And he told you nothing?
But they could see nothing.
It was full of people.
They know nothing about it.
All right then, sit down.
Well, sit down.
Well yes, you are right.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Hold on a minute.
What have they done?
Is that a fact?
Yes, there it is.
