Too much of this.
What on earth does this mean?
Too much for me now.
What is that in your hand?
Very well, show him to me.
And in she went.
This is the first act.
Why is that?
Do you know me?
Where to, now?
Look at me.
There is the little boy.
It must be where you put it.
Which house is it?
What do you mean?
But where is it?
But who was your mother?
Where did he come from?
do you come from the end of the world?
Where are we to turn for help?
Do you think so?
How does he use it?
Now, go home.
We must come back.
Where could he be?
She was the cause of it all.
We are who we say we are.
Try it on.
He was here.
Is it large?
Get out and play.
What is his name?
Large or small?
They had all been very good to us.
He has more to give.
And where is he now?
Is he a good man?
And what about your mother?
Do you think she was?
You think so?
Now, you know me.
But you must.
this one, too?
Look at it other way round.
No, mother.
Were you here before me?
What does all this mean?
And where is it?
Is it as good now?
What did you say that for?
Will you try?
No, tell me.
All in good time.
You think so, too?
It is great.
Where does he live?
But why do you ask me?
All right, then.
And how in the world did you find them?
Give it me.
Come with me.
But where are we to go?
How can you think of such a thing?
What does one live for?
Where are we?
What you have just said is good, very good.
You are all very kind to me.
But this is the point.
Here it is, he said.
And why is that?
Why is he here?
Well, here he is.
She came up to them.
Give it to me, then.
And do you know why?
How long have you been here?
Well then, what do you want?
Now come here.
What do you mean by that?
But why do you ask?
Come with me, then.
Where are they off to now?
What would you have me do?
But what does it mean?
You must come now.
Think of him.
And how old were you at that time?
But what about me?
She was right.
And off we go.
Why did he come?
And what is her name?
And where is this man?
Tell me his name.
Show me the way he went.
They are here.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Are you back again?
Where are you?
Is it any good?
Get out of the way.
Well, tell me.
How did that help you?
Good day to you.
Read that, she said.
How did you get here?
Come and help me.
Well then, tell him so.
When will it take place?
Who is that man?
You can say what it is.
Where is she?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
What did he say?
Is she well?
But it is just so with the world.
He is at my house.
Say what you want.
And where is she, then?
She went on.
You know, you see right through people.
Are they like each other?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Where have they been?
Do you want me to do it?
See, here it is.
where did she come from?
How old was she?
Tell me all about it.
What more could a man ask for?
Why are you here?
Much good that would be.
Is he big?
Well, and is that all?
And have you been here long?
He was there too.
Is that right?
Where are you from?
Tell us all about it.
Where is he now?
Well, go on.
What do you play?
Where have you been?
Will you come with me?
One, two, three.
There is no one here to see.
Come with me to the little house.
Just look through it.
Why, what is it, then?
How could she say such a thing.
Give me your hand.
How can you find out?
Now we see the light.
Well, what do you think?
What was his name?
Now where did they come from?
That was very good.
Why are they here?
Well, all right.
This is the man.
Then they will follow you?
Would you now like to look round my place?
Now it was time to act.
There was no one near.
What do they want?
You are a good boy.
It is all the same.
Give me my work.
And it did me good.
That was a good time.
We are here.
Well, how did it go?
But he is right.
Give me more than that
Just look at her.
Think no more about that.
Think what you will.
Take some, she said.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
What could set you off in the first place?
Why, what do you mean?
What do they say was the cause?
Show me the way.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Is that all you want?
Some day you may ask me about it.
In what part of the house?
How can you say that?
What could she mean by it?
Go and try.
They want more.
Get to work.
Is it all right?
Tell us your name.
What do you think of her?
That is all one can say about her.
And what do you think?
Three, he said.
That is right.
There she is again.
You must take me with you.
And where was the place?
There, that does me good.
How much are they?
Can you help me find my way?
Did you tell him?
This is my point.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Just like me.
If you want to know, go and find out.
What is your name?
Well, read it.
Then will come our time.
Hand it in.
Tell me about it.
And that was the end of it.
Why do you want water?
Ask her, he said.
Good, he said.
What does it all mean?
It was high time.
Where do you live?
What did you say your name was?
take them all.
Where is he?
And who is the man?
You can help me here.
You are right.
You were near him.
Is this the man?
Follow me, said the man.
Here is the way we put in the time.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Such as what?
For how much?
We will say no more about it, then.
Only two there now.
There was work to do.
This for me?
Is it you or me?
To what end?
She has a house?
But he does so need a mother.
Now tell me.
What a good thing it would be.
He was so kind.
Then what kind is it?
He was at work again.
Where did you place it?
What will each of you give?
How does she use you?
Very well then.
And a very good thing, too.
Do you think so now?
Call me what you will, he said.
He said that that would help.
What on earth do you mean?
How old are you?
Play with them.
What is in your hand?
Are you at it again?
Very well, he said.
What do you think of this?
It is the same thing.
You will get on in the world.
It is very high.
What do you want to ask these people?
Now, what do you want with me?
Been back long?
But what did you want?
Can you point it out to me?
Too much in the way.
That is just my point.
Well, did he?
And what will they do with us?
When will her mother come?
He will ask for it.
there are only two.
At your house?
What did he tell you?
It is very kind of you.
When will he come back?
What have you been after?
Say no more.
In what year?
And what are they made of?
Give him air.
There is no place like home.
There is more to tell.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Are you here for good?
Put it on.
He said too much.
It would be very kind of you.
That was a house to look at.
She has been with him many long years.
See, they are here.
How on earth do you know?
Can you take me?
Give me a light.
The first act was over.
He will live.
That is right, said the old man.
You are most kind.
What was it you said to me?
He went to him.
Move on, then.
I would like to see her again in that.
What do you want?
What do you think of him?
Who are these men?
Show it to me.
Have you been here long?
Who will tell her?
What does he mean?
Read that, he said.
Is there no one who can help me?
What do you want me to do?
It was now his turn to look about him.
Take this and this.
How did you get me out?
Here is my hand.
Turn this way.
It will take a little time.
What do you think of that?
Where do they get that?
Do it for me.
Here she is.
What does she want?
Where in the world did you come from?
Why do you want to know?
Show us where you live, said the man.
How can you tell?
Why are you like this?
Here it is.
What does she think about me?
Ask him to show up?
What will you say?
And what did he say?
There will just be time.
The world is before you.
But where is he?
And what did she say?
How much do you want?
Where are you off to?
You see it every day.
And what was his name?
After three, he said.
For some man.
Well, how are you?
Good day, one and all.
That is the end of her.
Will you take me to her?
She had to tell him.
And they went home.
Then why are you here?
That would be very good.
Is there some for me?
Well, and what do you think?
He went on his way.
Tell me who made the world.
You must tell me.
How do you take it?
Say no more about it.
And how did you find out?
Well, what do you think about it?
Time to get out.
Think it over.
