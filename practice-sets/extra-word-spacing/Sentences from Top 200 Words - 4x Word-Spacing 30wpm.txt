What do you mean by that?
All in good time.
She had to tell him.
Is it you or me?
He said too much.
For how much?
We must come back.
What could set you off in the first place?
This is the first act.
Give it to me, then.
Where have they been?
Give me more than that
Why are they here?
Where are you from?
What do they want?
How did you get me out?
Call me what you will, he said.
That is just my point.
Is it any good?
But what did you want?
How can you tell?
Look at it other way round.
But where is he?
Can you help me find my way?
There she is again.
And why is that?
Ask her, he said.
How does she use you?
Can you point it out to me?
What was it you said to me?
Is it all right?
Too much for me now.
That is right, said the old man.
Good, he said.
There will just be time.
No, mother.
Very well, show him to me.
But why do you ask me?
Just look at her.
There is no one here to see.
Well, what do you think?
Move on, then.
Do you think so?
Tell me all about it.
In what year?
Good day, one and all.
Is this the man?
Give me your hand.
Do it for me.
The first act was over.
You must take me with you.
Can you take me?
Why did he come?
where did she come from?
Well, what do you think about it?
Is that right?
Read that, he said.
All right, then.
It must be where you put it.
It would be very kind of you.
Are you here for good?
She was right.
You are a good boy.
He will ask for it.
And off we go.
This is my point.
How can you think of such a thing?
Give him air.
What did you say your name was?
But what about me?
Where is he?
How did that help you?
How old was she?
Where do they get that?
Where are they off to now?
Now it was time to act.
Where did he come from?
For some man.
Hand it in.
And have you been here long?
He is at my house.
It is great.
And where is he now?
Where are you?
And what do you think?
Now come here.
Where have you been?
How can you say that?
What more could a man ask for?
But who was your mother?
Some day you may ask me about it.
Why are you like this?
Do you want me to do it?
Time to get out.
What is in your hand?
And what was his name?
Well, here he is.
How could she say such a thing.
Who are these men?
There is more to tell.
What you have just said is good, very good.
Who will tell her?
Is that all you want?
What was his name?
Say what you want.
And what will they do with us?
Are you at it again?
Now, you know me.
We are who we say we are.
But it is just so with the world.
You think so, too?
Come with me.
And they went home.
There, that does me good.
He said that that would help.
And what is her name?
Think of him.
There was work to do.
Well, how are you?
Been back long?
Go and try.
Think it over.
Tell us all about it.
What do you want me to do?
That is the end of her.
Where is she?
Well, and is that all?
What do you want?
There is the little boy.
Just like me.
Give me a light.
You must tell me.
That was a good time.
Take this and this.
What does she think about me?
That would be very good.
In what part of the house?
Is he big?
And what are they made of?
How did you get here?
What does it all mean?
What do you mean?
What did you say that for?
When will her mother come?
Is it as good now?
How on earth do you know?
Get out of the way.
She came up to them.
What on earth does this mean?
Too much of this.
Why do you want to know?
Where do you live?
Would you now like to look round my place?
She has been with him many long years.
And where is it?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Did you tell him?
Come with me to the little house.
They are here.
What does one live for?
What did he tell you?
Follow me, said the man.
And who is the man?
But what does it mean?
That was very good.
What did he say?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Where is he now?
But where is it?
See, here it is.
Well, and what do you think?
After three, he said.
What will each of you give?
Only two there now.
Give it me.
What do you play?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Try it on.
You know, you see right through people.
When will he come back?
We will say no more about it, then.
Turn this way.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Here is the way we put in the time.
He went to him.
What is his name?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
It is all the same.
Where are you off to?
What do you think of this?
Well, all right.
Are you back again?
Is there no one who can help me?
She has a house?
Here she is.
Will you try?
Well, how did it go?
This for me?
He was there too.
No, tell me.
Were you here before me?
Look at me.
Good day to you.
Ask him to show up?
And a very good thing, too.
What will you say?
Here is my hand.
do you come from the end of the world?
Then why are you here?
She went on.
Say no more about it.
You are most kind.
Then they will follow you?
You must come now.
But he is right.
Tell me his name.
Very well, he said.
What is your name?
How long have you been here?
Give me my work.
How old are you?
Say no more.
How much do you want?
And do you know why?
There is no place like home.
Such as what?
What have you been after?
They want more.
You will get on in the world.
Come with me, then.
This is the man.
She was the cause of it all.
At your house?
Well then, what do you want?
And what about your mother?
What does all this mean?
Where did you place it?
And how did you find out?
Now, go home.
Will you come with me?
See, they are here.
Just look through it.
Is he a good man?
What does she want?
Too much in the way.
But you must.
It is the same thing.
take them all.
Show me the way he went.
But where are we to go?
Think what you will.
Well, did he?
That is right.
You can say what it is.
What do you want to ask these people?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Tell me who made the world.
this one, too?
You are all very kind to me.
Is there some for me?
Come and help me.
It is very high.
They had all been very good to us.
Now, what do you want with me?
Do you think she was?
But why do you ask?
And how old were you at that time?
And what did she say?
What do you think of him?
You were near him.
What does he mean?
He went on his way.
Is she well?
You think so?
Why is that?
Are they like each other?
Have you been here long?
Where could he be?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
You see it every day.
If you want to know, go and find out.
It was now his turn to look about him.
You are right.
Well, go on.
Very well then.
What on earth do you mean?
Well then, tell him so.
What do they say was the cause?
Much good that would be.
Why is he here?
What could she mean by it?
And it did me good.
Think no more about that.
Here it is, he said.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Is it large?
The world is before you.
It is very kind of you.
Now we see the light.
I would like to see her again in that.
Large or small?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
What is that in your hand?
Do you know me?
What a good thing it would be.
Why are you here?
He was so kind.
Play with them.
Where does he live?
It will take a little time.
There was no one near.
Get out and play.
Which house is it?
He was here.
Why, what is it, then?
How can you find out?
It was high time.
How much are they?
Put it on.
Well, read it.
And how in the world did you find them?
Then what kind is it?
What do you think of her?
What would you have me do?
He will live.
But he does so need a mother.
We are here.
That was a house to look at.
And where was the place?
Where are we to turn for help?
Get to work.
When will it take place?
Why do you want water?
How does he use it?
Will you take me to her?
Well, tell me.
Tell us your name.
Where to, now?
Here it is.
And where is this man?
Then will come our time.
One, two, three.
And what did he say?
And that was the end of it.
Where are we?
Who is that man?
Now tell me.
Read that, she said.
But this is the point.
Show me the way.
there are only two.
And where is she, then?
To what end?
Why, what do you mean?
He has more to give.
Take some, she said.
He was at work again.
Tell me about it.
Now where did they come from?
That is all one can say about her.
Three, he said.
Where in the world did you come from?
And in she went.
What do you think of that?
Do you think so now?
How do you take it?
You can help me here.
Show it to me.
