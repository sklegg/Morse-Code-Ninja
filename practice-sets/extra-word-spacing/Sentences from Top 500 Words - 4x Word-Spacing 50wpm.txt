Lead me to him.
What have they done?
Come, and we can rest together.
It is a real bed.
And sit in the dark?
What a game.
is it come yet?
Good to rest once in a way.
Play the game out.
Is it certain?
Nothing she can eat?
Of course he was right.
Then he must be a wonder.
Is that possible?
Get to bed.
Oh let me in.
He is among us.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Did it all rest on me?
Well yes, you are right.
It is possible.
Yes, it is true.
Go in there and drive them out.
What kind of voice is it?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
She heard and saw nothing.
Fly, my friend.
We must be quick.
There was more to be done.
All of this was possible.
My mind is made up.
And here is the note.
Wait a minute.
Yes, it did.
Free to do what?
Who gave it to you?
Come back to us as soon as possible.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
You could see there was a story behind it.
It was brought to me.
Half the town was there.
There is your old bed.
Yes, all right.
Did he fall?
The island was a mile long.
She was still game.
There is a lot of people.
There, by the wheel.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
It was a dark night.
It was full of people.
Answer me that, miss.
He ran up to them.
And he told you nothing?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Oh, nothing.
Money is no object?
He had, to be sure, done much.
Do you have my note?
Well, miss?
The city was soon behind me.
But let us see your plan.
How was it done?
Oh, how can you sleep?
See what you have done.
and so he decide he go back home.
Sit down, he said.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
The little boy lay in his bed.
Are you strong?
Never mind me.
No, nothing at all.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
They would cry.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
It is nothing.
Now we must wait.
Do you see that island?
Just let us go free.
Well, there he stood.
Laugh, if you will.
But never mind that.
That is possible.
Let him go free?
Oh, you are there.
Bring this with you.
You are free to do so.
She gave me her hand.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
He had made up his mind.
Behind my bed.
Let me see your plan.
She could think of nothing more to say.
It has to be done.
Very well, wait a minute.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Wonder what he does.
This voice was that of my father.
Oh, man.
Go back to bed.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
You must stay.
It was a kind of language between us.
Well, sit down by me.
Yes, but what did she say?
It was a record run.
Like these in shape and size?
Which box do you mean?
Yes, he said, all of it.
And then the game began all over again.
Of course they will.
He never said nothing.
You can sleep here.
Yes, she said.
Oh, but you were there?
Help me sit up.
He was here a minute ago.
The old man gave no answer.
Oh, take me with you.
All right then, sit down.
Yes, said the old man.
Oh, go on.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Oh, tell me.
Wait for me here, all of you.
But that is nothing to us.
Why should my father fly?
She got her hand free.
Yes, she was back.
At his side was a large green box.
His first cry was for his father.
It was hot.
They know nothing about it.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Are they on foot?
He left long ago.
Oh, take those off.
She began to cry.
Oh, that is very simple.
Try to sleep.
Yes, that is true.
We are free to act and think.
How can a little dog laugh?
You are in my power.
In a minute.
How was that possible?
What have you done?
Oh, he is so kind.
Yes, my love?
We are more strong together.
Her voice was low.
Better sit still.
It was so very long ago.
Be back in a minute.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
He saw nothing.
Yes, go on.
Oh, do as you like.
The snow is deep.
You know nothing about it.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Can it be possible?
Your voice is that of a young man.
Decide if you are going back home.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Be quick, for the time is short.
But they could see nothing.
Well, what does that lead up to?
That was well done.
All that for nothing?
This made him wonder more and more.
Well, of course.
You know you must say yes.
Hold on a minute.
Yes, but only for you and me.
How is that done?
Wait a second.
Is that a fact?
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Wait and see.
Behind every book is a man.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Nothing at all.
It was a cold, dark night.
You must stay with me.
Yes, you are right.
The whole day had been hot.
Well, sit down.
Oh, that.
Oh, do you know?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Yes, we know that.
They all fall to the ground.
Oh, this is too much.
Yes, what is it?
Oh, very well, he said.
Is he in bed?
A fine thing too.
Money is power.
Oh, all right.
Wonder if he has a name.
Wonder is it like that.
He must be in the same boat as us.
They need a rest.
Nothing could be more simple.
It is very clear.
Sit down, said the old man.
It is no use, said a voice.
What age is he?
It was a very dark night.
Did she fall?
What has brought you here?
And you can do nothing until then?
Yes, he said.
He began to laugh.
Oh, no.
You will fall.
What more is to be done?
The whole night the tree stood still.
It stood behind the door.
What is power?
And what have you done to me?
Who brought you up?
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Is my father in town?
Leave the rest to me.
It is his voice.
No, nothing of the kind.
You love a certain person.
Here is our plan.
It might have done me good.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
It was so long ago.
Then it is certain?
He stood up.
There is no possible way.
It must be done at once.
Oh, do the best you can.
But how long ago?
Yes, she could sing that.
But she is nothing to me now.
How long would you keep me in town?
You better stay here all night.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Go and rest.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
And yet you said he had money.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
The night was dark.
Yes, very well.
Clear my name.
His plan is very simple.
They call him a fine boy.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
It was right in front of us.
Just go to sleep.
It was a warm night.
Why, of course.
If only they would be quick.
Oh, if men only knew.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Nothing had come of it.
All was dark.
Yes, sit down.
It must be done.
What have they done with my work?
He knew nothing.
And what a voice she has.
It is all done.
How long ago?
Where can you wait for me?
But wait a minute.
It is certain.
Do you talk in your sleep?
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Yes and no.
My mind was soon made up.
That is a fact.
Nothing new under the sun.
I hear his voice in the house.
Bring it here.
Yes, go and find out.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Is it possible?
There is no one in that room behind you.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Then lead the way.
That would be a fine thing.
Never mind how he came here.
Oh, of course.
But it must be done soon.
Nothing is more simple.
Stay where you are.
He gave me this paper.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Clear the table.
It is time for bed.
It is done.
Yes, to be sure.
In that town there is a street.
He must wait.
Why did you bring him here?
Well then, be quick.
Let her wait.
Yes, and no.
Oh, dont ask me.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Wait for me.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
This is a test.
Keep clear of him.
There is nothing more to be said.
Yes, of course.
Perhaps he did.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Then all was dark again.
But what must be done?
He will sleep an hour.
Clear the way.
Look at that dark water.
His will be done.
Did she stay long?
What can be done?
Oh, to be sure.
Let us sit down.
Of course it might.
What is done is done.
It was cold and dark.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Never mind that.
Well, what about my plan?
It was done.
Yes, once.
You must have a rest.
Of course she will.
Bring them here.
It was very dark.
What did the letter contain?
Quick, friend, quick.
The night was very dark.
And yet you are the better off?
Will you rest here a little?
He is in the box.
You brought no one with you?
He brought it with him for us to see.
What brought you here?
Fine, very fine.
Oh, just listen.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Oh, come now.
Of course it is.
Nothing could have been better.
Yes, he did.
You can hear that, miss?
People might know my voice and find me out.
Take good note of it.
Yes, there it is.
Come quick.
He has a good voice still.
Again came the voice.
Dont laugh.
The water ran dry.
We brought them in.
What has he done?
You knew it, and said nothing?
But what then must be done?
