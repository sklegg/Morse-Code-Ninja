It was from you.
What are you up to?
And do you like him?
Can one see from there?
And who was that?
What do they call you?
Who and what are you?
Do you know what you look like?
What can this be?
Do you see it?
How can you know?
How did you know about it?
What do you make of that?
That was it.
How is he now?
She has it.
Who are you?
Will that do?
Do as you like.
So there it was.
How can it be?
Which is it?
And could she see him?
That will do, said he.
Look at it this way.
And how did you find out?
And who are you?
Would you like some?
Then there is more to do.
What DO you know of him?
Look at it.
There is but one thing to do.
Did you see it?
Who will go first?
Who is she?
What is it all about?
Come this way.
And what do you call her?
And what is that?
What did you do then?
Then what is it?
Do you like him?
Did you know her?
The time had come.
But he had to have it.
There he is, do you see him?
are you there?
Do you know her?
What other way is there to look at it?
You have it.
You know how it is with her.
What have you come for?
How is she?
You can go.
Do as you will.
When was it?
Did you see her?
Look over it.
Or so they said.
And what was it for?
How are you?
But how is that?
But what are you up to?
Is she like him?
Is it time?
You can have some.
What is he like?
What was he like?
But what will you do?
There he is, she said.
Tqhen you may go.
And when will you call?
How long has he been there?
May we come in?
but we can go and see.
And who is this?
Look at them.
But it was of no use.
what has she to do with it?
So be it.
How do you do?
And what do you make of it?
What time is it?
And do you like her?
Would you do what he did?
Then, how do you know?
What is there to see?
Is that it?
No was there one?
At what time?
But what is it?
What could it be?
Did you know him?
And what did you see?
The time will come.
Who was he?
No one will come, she said.
What was it?
What can we do, then?
He said no.
Is it like him?
Is that her?
They said no more.
But he had no time.
But who was she?
That will do, he said.
Had to look the other way.
What do you make of it?
Then who are you?
Did you know them?
Has it come to this?
Look at him.
What is it like?
What do you see?
What is it for?
Now what are we to do with you?
What would she have said?
Can it be?
How did he do it?
But how about you?
Then what are you up to now?
But it has been so long.
But will he see it?
We have him.
But what have they been up to?
And is that all?
What are we to do?
We have no water.
Who was that?
And what did you do then?
And all for what?
You have them?
How did she do it?
What is that?
There were two of them.
Can you do that?
How is he?
Then make it up.
So it is.
who can it be?
That is a long time.
There they are.
Do you know what it is?
but there was more to it than this.
Do you know?
You know more than we do.
Call him in.
But when will that be?
You may go.
One or two?
There you are, he said.
So that was the way.
Now there is no more to be said.
Do you see him?
Do they know him?
what is it?
That is what she did.
When is it?
and so on, and so on.
Will you come and see her?
Go on, he said.
Is he there?
So it was.
What did they do?
That was all she said.
What was it about?
There he is, you see.
Then how many are there?
Now you know.
who, then, are you?
Is it over?
How would you like to have it?
But WHAT DID you see?
How was that?
Are you there?
There you are.
How did you come by it?
Do you know him?
Is that all?
At what number?
What is all this?
You can do it.
Out of the way.
What did he do to you?
And has it come to this?
What will you do, then?
When was that?
but what if it is?
But so it is.
What is it about?
Now is your time.
And what do you make of it?
What was he like?
You may go.
What do they call you?
When was it?
One or two?
Are you there?
Or so they said.
Did you know them?
What do you make of it?
But how is that?
Can it be?
Now there is no more to be said.
How was that?
Will that do?
But who was she?
but there was more to it than this.
What can this be?
Now you know.
Did you know her?
That will do, he said.
And is that all?
They said no more.
who can it be?
There is but one thing to do.
What was it?
Who is she?
How is he now?
Do you know him?
Then what are you up to now?
and so on, and so on.
That is what she did.
Now what are we to do with you?
What is it like?
That was it.
There you are, he said.
He said no.
And all for what?
So it was.
Do they know him?
What did they do?
Who and what are you?
And do you like her?
What did you do then?
And who are you?
What would she have said?
You know more than we do.
Then, how do you know?
What DO you know of him?
Go on, he said.
What is it for?
And has it come to this?
And do you like him?
What is that?
And could she see him?
And what is that?
How did you know about it?
But when will that be?
How do you do?
The time will come.
But what is it?
How can you know?
Did you see her?
How did you come by it?
And what do you call her?
Come this way.
Now is your time.
How can it be?
How did she do it?
Who was he?
And what was it for?
Is she like him?
How long has he been there?
What was it about?
There he is, she said.

Look over it.
Call him in.
That was all she said.
What are we to do?
She has it.

Do you see him?
But it was of no use.
Can one see from there?
What do you make of that?
Then how many are there?
But what are you up to?
Do you know what you look like?
Then what is it?
You can have some.
Did you know him?
Look at it.
What time is it?
Has it come to this?
But he had no time.
Would you like some?
Would you do what he did?
Who was that?
We have him.
what is it?
but we can go and see.
But how about you?
Look at it this way.
But WHAT DID you see?
Is it time?
but what if it is?
