It was true.
How do you feel now?
Listen to them, he said.
What kind of a bird?
It was a round table.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Is your family well?
If you only knew.
She told me all about it.
He got it this morning.
Why do they want to make her sing?
Leave off that.
And serve them right.
He had my love.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Light my fire.
How does it feel?
Who told you that?
who told you you could?
Pass this way, then.
They had much to talk about.
An hour and a half.
And what does she want the money for?
Feel better then.
Do you know that old lay?
She is the first person in this house.
It will interest you, said he.
They are still young.
What is love?
It would be better if you went to the war.
It is a fire.
Are you ready to play?
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Is that true?
But one day you must feel it.
To know her is to love her.
They knew it.
Where he was, no one knew.
Do you remember?
You are on a ship?
Never heard of him.
Ten, did you say?
Half a mile?
Keep in step.
She knew at once.
He is better than any of you.
But let that pass.
We will talk about that.
Then what would happen?
Did he though?
Every word you said was heard.
Are you all ready?
Does he love you?
And how did he make his money?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
You are a good girl.
You are in love with me?
Are you in love with her?
That is very simple.
Pull it more to your side.
what could be better?
One other question, said he.
You are right, my love.
There was no wind.
We dont know enough.
But listen to me.
She is fast?
The King Went to him.
And why do you serve?
Was he young or old?
How short his time.
As soon as you left, it began.
Never heard of it before.
Answer me this one question.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
We call it black.
Did they ever go back?
Where are you off to so early?
We knew them both.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Let us leave them, she said.
What have you against me now?
Now listen to me.
Look to the west.
It was true to life.
We had a list.
It is true.
Pull together.
Leave me out of the question.
No more money?
Is your man white or black?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
That would be the best way.
Can she sing?
How far from the body?
Is the wind north or south?
Put down three and carry five.
That is true.
Are we ready?
Better cross here.
What a question.
What will happen to us?
The night was cold.
That is enough for me.
And so they began to talk.
Long live the king.
In an hour?
He said, the work is now complete.
What do you mean by that question?
Do you love her much?
How many children did he leave?
Young man, you will go far.
Have you told her?
Ask them to sing one more song.
We are ready.
Long and the short of it.
You will soon know.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
That may be true.
How did this happen?
You are cold.
Ten will be early enough.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
He never told us what it was she said.
Had you heard?
Are you still cold?
But she is very young.
You were told.
He will leave me.
Did you tell him your whole story?
Let that pass.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
The night was cold and still.
A young man?
You remember the place, my father?
Remember that time?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Let us pass.
But how simple it is.
So the question was, what to do?
Let us talk about you.
This money was for her.
you must step out.
She was only a little girl.
You may go, said the King.
Little girl, where have you been?
It is cold.
This was true.
From then on it was war between them.
Read them, said the King.
She must be told.
Listen to me.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
Let me see him, said the young man.
It is a rock.
Let me also ask you a question.
Made me feel so young.
And will you direct us?
Are you better?
A better man than you.
Half as many is too much.
We had better go in.
That is enough.
What a state he was in.
They told me to.
He never heard.
You must leave that to me.
Can you sing?
And so they knew that it was true.
You must travel.
We took our leave early, and left together.
But he never heard me.
That was the rule, she said.
And you are still so young.
Has she any family?
Take good care of the little girl.
What have you heard?
How do you feel?
And you can sing?
It was all she could do to hold in.
You had better go.
Fire and water, earth and air.
That must be true.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
We must make the best of it.
You are right, young man.
The family was at home.
She was a good girl.
Against what side?
The world is big enough.
We were up early.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
What does he feel?
An example would be better.
She had very little notice from him.
Are you here on leave?
Why do we love?
She was so young, too.
No, he is a man about my size.
Have you a family?
How soon will he be here?
They all heard me.
Then you will know me better.
Do you remember him?
When did this happen?
you should know her better than me.
Let me hear from you soon.
Then get ready at once.
No less, no more.
No, my love.
Listen to him.
Why do you serve?
He has money.
Where did they get the money from?
I have no children to love me.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
That was the question.
He said, get him out of the road.
You love him?
But enough of this.
And you will always love him?
Is it true?
Your true father?
How could that happen?
There are four hundred?
She is very plain.
They had several children.
What will happen now?
In short, take me.
They had heard all that before.
She knew what was good for children.
And dont talk to me.
Take a hold of it.
If you know it, that is enough.
What size do you want?
Now, listen.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Why talk to me?
We serve them.
It would have been more simple.
A house is on fire?
Let me remember what he said.
It is a young girl.
The rock was very small.
Try it on the dog first.
Do you own a dog?
Who was it told me his name?
Better late than never.
Much of it was true.
It has been there ever since.
But what did we ever get for it?
Your watch is slow.
Well, young man?
The dog is always with him.
This will pass in no time.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
It can never happen.
Can it be true?
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Have you heard?
They left in the morning.
It is the rule.
But why must you leave me so soon?
She is much better.
He had enough of it.
About the usual time.
He knew them.
Let us talk a little about my father.
On fire, on fire.
You know me well enough.
Before you leave, tell us.
Will you answer that question?
She told me to ask you.
Let this man pass.
Never heard of it.
Do you remember me?
Hold it up to the light.
They can have all our half of the house.
It was cold.
Well, are you ready?
Who told you so?
Have you heard from him often?
So we came down this road.
What can happen?
You can pass through the door.
But listen to this, he said.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
We got her half way.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
You will always love him?
This is my body.
You saw the person?
Hold her hand.
Had they been heard?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
You are better than that.
Five young children.
Does she go fast?
So do you, my love.
You have an hour.
And then he told all he knew.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Do you love me?
Take notice.
What is there to talk about?
Better write it here.
Do you want any money?
He put his hand over part of the map.
This is simple.
Are you ready?
Which king?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
He is very simple.
Did you get any money?
And that is the whole point.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
You may leave the room.
you know better than that.
When do you leave?
How does this happen?
Leave any for him?
Listen to this, will you?
Why did it happen?
Are they made to order?
