He is among us.
Bring it here.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
But what must be done?
Here is our plan.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Yes, we know that.
He saw nothing.
And you can do nothing until then?
Good to rest once in a way.
Well then, be quick.
How was that possible?
The city was soon behind me.
Just let us go free.
You are in my power.
They know nothing about it.
What has brought you here?
His will be done.
Of course it is.
Take good note of it.
That would be a fine thing.
Nothing new under the sun.
Clear the table.
Yes, you are right.
Who gave it to you?
But let us see your plan.
Yes, it did.
He left long ago.
How long would you keep me in town?
Be quick, for the time is short.
Oh, come now.
Is my father in town?
Why, of course.
Nothing at all.
Is that a fact?
Wonder what he does.
But that is nothing to us.
He knew nothing.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
It is nothing.
Again came the voice.
Let me see your plan.
What has he done?
It was so long ago.
and so he decide he go back home.
Oh, just listen.
Yes, go on.
Of course she will.
Did it all rest on me?
He gave me this paper.
Why should my father fly?
Did she stay long?
Very well, wait a minute.
There is a lot of people.
He is in the box.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Well, sit down by me.
It was cold and dark.
At his side was a large green box.
You can sleep here.
Free to do what?
Well, sit down.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
There was more to be done.
They call him a fine boy.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
The snow is deep.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
And yet you are the better off?
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Oh, no.
The island was a mile long.
Yes, she said.
Yes, my love?
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
We must be quick.
It stood behind the door.
Behind my bed.
That is possible.
They need a rest.
Oh, very well, he said.
Nothing could have been better.
That was well done.
He began to laugh.
Then all was dark again.
Go back to bed.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Wait and see.
He must be in the same boat as us.
It is all done.
He never said nothing.
There is no one in that room behind you.
What have you done?
And what have you done to me?
Answer me that, miss.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Do you have my note?
Oh, if men only knew.
You know you must say yes.
Is that possible?
It was a warm night.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Are you strong?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Did she fall?
Yes, he did.
How long ago?
What kind of voice is it?
Sit down and let us talk it over.
He will sleep an hour.
You will fall.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Oh, do as you like.
And then the game began all over again.
It was a record run.
She began to cry.
He ran up to them.
Oh let me in.
Be back in a minute.
Oh, go on.
Look at that dark water.
Do you talk in your sleep?
It is done.
He stood up.
Let her wait.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Well, of course.
But what then must be done?
Behind every book is a man.
Clear the way.
See what you have done.
Try to sleep.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Yes, very well.
Of course they will.
Yes, she could sing that.
Oh, tell me.
But how long ago?
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Yes, that is true.
Oh, this is too much.
Is it certain?
Yes, that was a picture book.
He had made up his mind.
Leave the rest to me.
What have they done?
Well yes, you are right.
Yes and no.
No, nothing of the kind.
Of course it might.
Yes, sit down.
Are they on foot?
Laugh, if you will.
Bring them here.
Yes, what is it?
It was very dark.
But wait a minute.
Yes, he said.
You must stay.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Is he in bed?
Yes, but what did she say?
Oh, but you were there?
It was so very long ago.
Her voice was low.
Who brought you up?
And yet you said he had money.
Wait for me here, all of you.
He brought it with him for us to see.
What can be done?
My mind is made up.
How is that done?
Oh, of course.
If only they would be quick.
Well, miss?
Help me sit up.
You can hear that, miss?
But they could see nothing.
In her name, then, let it be done.
And here is the note.
Oh, that is very simple.
Yes, go and find out.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
What have they done with my work?
It is certain.
It has to be done.
Oh, man.
Oh, all right.
Oh, do you know?
Oh, take me with you.
It is possible.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Nothing she can eat?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Dont laugh.
Oh, that.
He must wait.
What age is he?
The old man gave no answer.
Hold on a minute.
Wonder if he has a name.
It might have done me good.
What more is to be done?
Can it be possible?
Keep clear of him.
It was right in front of us.
Yes, there it is.
Never mind me.
Well, what does that lead up to?
But she is nothing to me now.
My mind was soon made up.
Clear my name.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Wonder is it like that.
What a game.
You brought no one with you?
You must have a rest.
Quick, friend, quick.
What brought you here?
Bring this with you.
She heard and saw nothing.
It is a real bed.
You knew it, and said nothing?
Yes, once.
is it come yet?
Sit down, he said.
In a minute.
In that town there is a street.
Play the game out.
It is time for bed.
Never mind how he came here.
Oh, dont ask me.
This is a test.
Of course he was right.
Why did you bring him here?
Sit down, said the old man.
Why does the boat go so fast?
You could see there was a story behind it.
Money is no object?
Like these in shape and size?
This voice was that of my father.
Never mind that.
How can a little dog laugh?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing could be more simple.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Then he must be a wonder.
He was here a minute ago.
The water ran dry.
And what a voice she has.
It was a cold, dark night.
Oh, you are there.
Yes, said the old man.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Fine, very fine.
It was done.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Wait a minute.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Oh, take those off.
Come, and we can rest together.
It is very clear.
Oh, he is so kind.
We are free to act and think.
No, nothing at all.
Wait for me.
How was it done?
He had, to be sure, done much.
All that for nothing?
Come quick.
That is a fact.
Where can you wait for me?
Oh, how can you sleep?
He has a good voice still.
She was still game.
Now we must wait.
Let us sit down.
It must be done at once.
Which box do you mean?
Do you see that island?
Nothing is more simple.
Get to bed.
His first cry was for his father.
Lead me to him.
They all fall to the ground.
We are more strong together.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Well, what about my plan?
Go and rest.
Just go to sleep.
People might know my voice and find me out.
She gave me her hand.
Fly, my friend.
She could think of nothing more to say.
It was full of people.
His plan is very simple.
Then lead the way.
Go in there and drive them out.
Oh, do the best you can.
All right then, sit down.
It was brought to me.
There is nothing more to be said.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
There, by the wheel.
And sit in the dark?
Let him go free?
It is no use, said a voice.
And he told you nothing?
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
You must stay with me.
A fine thing too.
Yes, to be sure.
It was a very dark night.
They would cry.
Then it is certain?
But never mind that.
But it must be done soon.
Half the town was there.
It is his voice.
Nothing had come of it.
All was dark.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
I hear his voice in the house.
Well, there he stood.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Will you rest here a little?
Yes, of course.
There is no possible way.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Yes, and no.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
There is your old bed.
Decide if you are going back home.
It must be done.
Yes, it is true.
All of this was possible.
She got her hand free.
It was hot.
Perhaps he did.
Did he fall?
Is it possible?
It was a kind of language between us.
The night was very dark.
You know nothing about it.
This made him wonder more and more.
What did the letter contain?
We brought them in.
What is power?
You love a certain person.
Come, let me show you my plan.
You are free to do so.
Oh, to be sure.
Better sit still.
Yes, she was back.
Yes, all right.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Yes, he said, all of it.
The whole day had been hot.
It was a dark night.
The night was dark.
Money is power.
What is done is done.
Wait a second.
Stay where you are.
You better stay here all night.
