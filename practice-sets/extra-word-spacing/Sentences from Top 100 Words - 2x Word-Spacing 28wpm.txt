Who will go first?
What is it like?
Is she like him?
Look at them.
Do as you like.
But how about you?
You have it.
Would you do what he did?
But how is that?
What was it?
You may go.
But he had to have it.
Can you do that?
Then how many are there?
Is that it?
And what did you see?
Look at it this way.
but there was more to it than this.
but what if it is?
You know more than we do.
And what do you make of it?
We have him.
How can it be?
who, then, are you?
Who was that?
Do you know what you look like?
And who was that?
Then make it up.
And how did you find out?
Then what is it?
Look at him.
What is it about?
May we come in?
Then what are you up to now?
How do you do?
Tqhen you may go.
Come this way.
That is what she did.
Now is your time.
How did you come by it?
That was all she said.
Then who are you?
What did they do?
But when will that be?
So there it was.
Look at it.
What do you make of that?
And what is that?
What was he like?
The time will come.
There were two of them.
What is it for?
and so on, and so on.
Can it be?
are you there?
Do you know her?
Did you see her?
But it has been so long.
Is it time?
Do as you will.
There he is, do you see him?
One or two?
Which is it?
Out of the way.
They said no more.
Now there is no more to be said.
Had to look the other way.
Did you know her?
Do you like him?
What did you do then?
What did he do to you?
What is all this?
Did you know him?
So be it.
What is it all about?
Then there is more to do.
But what will you do?
What was it about?
Who and what are you?
What can we do, then?
How was that?
You can go.
How did he do it?
Who is she?
What can this be?
Would you like some?
Who was he?
What would she have said?
Did you see it?
But what is it?
Call him in.
So it was.
But it was of no use.
But what have they been up to?
What do you make of it?
But who was she?
How are you?
We have no water.
Do they know him?
How is she?
That will do, he said.
And is that all?
What have you come for?
She has it.
And all for what?
At what number?
Will that do?
You can do it.
You have them?
Will you come and see her?
How can you know?
That is a long time.
What DO you know of him?
Or so they said.
That was it.
Then, how do you know?
who can it be?
Do you know what it is?
How did you know about it?
But WHAT DID you see?
No one will come, she said.
When was it?
What time is it?
Look over it.
How is he now?
And who is this?
Is it like him?
What do you see?
There they are.
There you are.
So it is.
Do you know?
There he is, she said.
Who are you?
No was there one?
And what do you call her?
You can have some.
He said no.
How did she do it?
But what are you up to?
Do you know him?
At what time?
That will do, said he.
What will you do, then?
So that was the way.
Is he there?
Has it come to this?
Is that all?
How is he?
Is that her?
But so it is.
You know how it is with her.
But he had no time.
What other way is there to look at it?
How would you like to have it?
Are you there?
There he is, you see.
And what was it for?
Do you see him?
What do they call you?
There is but one thing to do.
Now you know.
When is it?
And has it come to this?
There you are, he said.
Can one see from there?
Is it over?
And do you like her?
Now what are we to do with you?
but we can go and see.
The time had come.
What is he like?
what is it?
And what did you do then?
And when will you call?
Do you see it?
What could it be?
what has she to do with it?
What is that?
Go on, he said.
When was that?
And do you like him?
Did you know them?
It was from you.
How long has he been there?
And could she see him?
What are you up to?
But will he see it?
And who are you?
What are we to do?
What is there to see?
You know how it is with her.
Then who are you?
Then what are you up to now?
How long has he been there?
They said no more.
but we can go and see.
Did you see it?
What time is it?
Do you know him?
What is all this?
Then make it up.
There is but one thing to do.
What could it be?
But how about you?
Tqhen you may go.

Will that do?
Do as you like.
Which is it?
Then how many are there?
But what are you up to?
How would you like to have it?
And what was it for?
Is that it?
What do you see?
Do you know what you look like?
You can do it.
What is it about?
Look at it.
Did you see her?
What is it like?
And has it come to this?
How are you?
When is it?
Do you know?
And how did you find out?
And what do you call her?
but there was more to it than this.

Look at them.
Look over it.
How do you do?
Now what are we to do with you?
What can we do, then?
At what time?
Are you there?
Did you know her?
You have them?
Who is she?
But what is it?
Then there is more to do.
Who are you?
What will you do, then?
What other way is there to look at it?
But what will you do?
There he is, do you see him?
What DO you know of him?
How did you come by it?
Who was that?
The time will come.
She has it.

And what do you make of it?
What do you make of that?
Can it be?
There he is, you see.
But WHAT DID you see?
Did you know them?
What are we to do?
But how is that?
Do you know what it is?
Do you like him?
May we come in?
That will do, said he.
So be it.
and so on, and so on.
What did they do?
Now is your time.
And what did you do then?
How can you know?

Then, how do you know?
Out of the way.
What do you make of it?
what has she to do with it?
That was it.
Do as you will.
Now there is no more to be said.
Is he there?
But who was she?
