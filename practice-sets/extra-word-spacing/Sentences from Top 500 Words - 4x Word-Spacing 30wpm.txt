He never said nothing.
You will fall.
But that is nothing to us.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
And yet you are the better off?
All that for nothing?
Well, miss?
Help me sit up.
The water ran dry.
You can sleep here.
But what then must be done?
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Now we must wait.
The island was a mile long.
Never mind that.
Yes, she could sing that.
Come quick.
He was here a minute ago.
Then lead the way.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Go back to bed.
Did she fall?
Do you have my note?
Oh, do you know?
No, nothing at all.
He is in the box.
He knew nothing.
How long would you keep me in town?
Let me see your plan.
Wait for me.
Wait for me here, all of you.
There, by the wheel.
Yes, once.
Yes, he did.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Yes, we know that.
All of this was possible.
There is your old bed.
He has a good voice still.
Go and rest.
There is a lot of people.
Yes, there it is.
Yes, she said.
How was that possible?
There is nothing more to be said.
It was brought to me.
Play the game out.
But she is nothing to me now.
And what have you done to me?
This made him wonder more and more.
They know nothing about it.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
In that town there is a street.
Never mind me.
We must be quick.
In a minute.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Yes, that is true.
His first cry was for his father.
Fine, very fine.
It was a record run.
Yes, what is it?
Sit down, said the old man.
That was well done.
Fly, my friend.
It is a real bed.
All was dark.
Oh, all right.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Perhaps he did.
Well, there he stood.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
All right then, sit down.
And yet you said he had money.
Behind my bed.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
We are more strong together.
Do you see that island?
Yes, my love?
Wonder what he does.
It was so very long ago.
What brought you here?
It must be a new moon out, she said.
It must be done at once.
Oh, take those off.
Oh, if men only knew.
It is done.
Of course it might.
Oh, do the best you can.
Well, sit down.
You must stay.
Yes, but what did she say?
Are they on foot?
And you can do nothing until then?
What has he done?
Wonder is it like that.
Better sit still.
It is certain.
But how long ago?
Then all was dark again.
Yes, he said, all of it.
It might have done me good.
Yes and no.
Did it all rest on me?
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Yes, all right.
Good to rest once in a way.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Yes, he said.
But let us see your plan.
Yes, and no.
Just go to sleep.
Here is our plan.
It was a very dark night.
Oh, do as you like.
His plan is very simple.
Bring them here.
It was a dark night.
Well yes, you are right.
Oh, but you were there?
Yes, you are right.
Her voice was low.
She heard and saw nothing.
You knew it, and said nothing?
The snow is deep.
My mind is made up.
Oh, nothing.
There was more to be done.
Laugh, if you will.
She began to cry.
We are free to act and think.
Yes, it did.
Oh, man.
What can be done?
That is a fact.
He had made up his mind.
is it come yet?
He ran up to them.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Yes, it is true.
What a game.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Why did you bring him here?
They would cry.
Is he in bed?
It was full of people.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Stay where you are.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
A fine thing too.
Keep clear of him.
Oh, to be sure.
Dont laugh.
But it must be done soon.
You love a certain person.
What kind of voice is it?
Never mind how he came here.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
It is his voice.
His will be done.
And here is the note.
Just let us go free.
It was hot.
Clear the table.
The whole day had been hot.
Who gave it to you?
If only they would be quick.
It is nothing.
He left long ago.
This is a test.
It was cold and dark.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
She gave me her hand.
He stood up.
What have they done with my work?
Free to do what?
He had, to be sure, done much.
Let her wait.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Wait a second.
Well, what about my plan?
People might know my voice and find me out.
It must be done.
Behind every book is a man.
The city was soon behind me.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Oh, take me with you.
It is possible.
You must have a rest.
You brought no one with you?
Who brought you up?
Oh, he is so kind.
Nothing could be more simple.
Oh, no.
Did she stay long?
It was very dark.
Quick, friend, quick.
Look at that dark water.
It has to be done.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Oh, this is too much.
How is that done?
Is my father in town?
The night was dark.
It was so long ago.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Is it possible?
Is that a fact?
Yes, go on.
At his side was a large green box.
Yes, she was back.
It was a cold, dark night.
Did he fall?
She could think of nothing more to say.
Well, of course.
Clear the way.
And he told you nothing?
The whole night the tree stood still.
That would be a fine thing.
Then it is certain?
That is possible.
Sit down, he said.
Oh, that.
Go in there and drive them out.
They need a rest.
He saw nothing.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
It is very clear.
Nothing new under the sun.
Why, of course.
See what you have done.
It was right in front of us.
Wonder if he has a name.
What is power?
She was still game.
Then he must be a wonder.
Yes, sit down.
Nothing is more simple.
You can hear that, miss?
You know you must say yes.
She got her hand free.
They all fall to the ground.
Do you talk in your sleep?
and so he decide he go back home.
The night was very dark.
They call him a fine boy.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
What did the letter contain?
Yes, to be sure.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
He gave me this paper.
Take good note of it.
Oh, come now.
You must stay with me.
And then the game began all over again.
There is no possible way.
What more is to be done?
It stood behind the door.
Bring it here.
Can it be possible?
Let him go free?
What have you done?
Is that possible?
You could see there was a story behind it.
Of course they will.
Answer me that, miss.
Nothing could have been better.
What have they done?
Get to bed.
Be quick, for the time is short.
It was done.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Will you rest here a little?
Of course he was right.
Why should my father fly?
Leave the rest to me.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Of course she will.
He must be in the same boat as us.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Oh, you are there.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Wait and see.
Wait a minute.
Nothing at all.
Let us sit down.
This voice was that of my father.
Bring this with you.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Money is power.
Try to sleep.
Be back in a minute.
Hold on a minute.
What age is he?
We brought them in.
Well then, be quick.
He must wait.
Oh, very well, he said.
Very well, wait a minute.
Well, sit down by me.
It is no use, said a voice.
It was a kind of language between us.
You better stay here all night.
How was it done?
I hear his voice in the house.
Oh, dont ask me.
But never mind that.
Yes, very well.
Are you strong?
The old man gave no answer.
Like these in shape and size?
You are in my power.
He will sleep an hour.
He is among us.
Money is no object?
The little boy lay in his bed.
Yes, that was a picture book.
And sit in the dark?
My mind was soon made up.
It was a warm night.
Where can you wait for me?
You are free to do so.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Clear my name.
What is done is done.
But what must be done?
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Yes, go and find out.
You know nothing about it.
Yes, said the old man.
Again came the voice.
Oh, of course.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Oh, tell me.
Oh, that is very simple.
Of course it is.
He began to laugh.
How long ago?
It is time for bed.
Is it certain?
Nothing had come of it.
No, nothing of the kind.
What has brought you here?
Lead me to him.
Oh let me in.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
How can a little dog laugh?
And what a voice she has.
Yes, but only for you and me.
But they could see nothing.
It is all done.
Decide if you are going back home.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Yes, of course.
Oh, just listen.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Oh, go on.
Which box do you mean?
But wait a minute.
There is no one in that room behind you.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Nothing she can eat?
Come, and we can rest together.
Half the town was there.
