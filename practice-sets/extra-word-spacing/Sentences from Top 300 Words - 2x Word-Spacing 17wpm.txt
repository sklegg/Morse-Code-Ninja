No, said the Tree.
Sure of what?
One never has too much.
You must study.
He saw his men draw back.
You must walk.
Where have you been this long while?
And now, good night.
Keep watch all night.
That was the first night.
Here we see the boy at school.
She might be at his house.
Let me go back.
Let me see her.
Can you stand?
But then you would be close to the sea?
Where has she run off to?
It is music.
Let us cross over.
Tell us a story.
We found it.
Is that far?
They never come back.
Tell her to begin.
Do you hear me?
How did it begin?
We must begin again.
Did you see his eye?
What is your real name?
It was white.
We got under way at last.
But then it will be too late.
What country does he come from?
One night more and he would be on his way.
Does he never go out?
Have you found it?
But now it is too late.
And your children?
The sun had set long since.
Have you got that?
See him grow up.
It is a long story.
It is open?
If you know, why dont you tell?
She is my friend.
Let me see him.
He had two left feet.
He is my friend.
You must eat now.
Right here it began.
You got me?
This is real.
And now let us go home.
Is it far?
Then let me have a word with you.
We are together.
There, do you hear?
Is he a real father?
Take care of him.
Why should they?
What do you think when you hear music?
We should look at this.
So they got out and went in.
This is what began it all.
Do you want some more to eat?
Let me hear what it is.
But you got to play music for them.
Let them have it.
Let me be and let me live.
You are sure of that?
Is it in the city?
And this food?
Where is the river?
Here he is at last.
We never thought of that.
This took him some time.
At last we have a man.
Dont say that to me.
Now or never.
How many are left?
Just cut it out, will you?
Who let you in?
Who did you learn that from?
It was then time to start.
Good night again.
That is the idea.
Just cut it out.
They are hard at it.
You found him?
They dont care.
My father is right.
And he left the room.
Do you know how he made his mark?
Look at his face.
Let her go.
A call for help, you thought?
Think of my father.
The other night she left.
Who can answer for that?
She must have a hard time with him.
There to the left.
Let me out.
Our own people must come first.
She came over last night.
Let me see him at once.
How could you begin?
Give me the letter.
Was you in my room?
She got up.
These were the first people we saw.
How many children?
And who is this friend?
Let him follow me.
Cut him down.
It is from your father.
Now let me have it.
Stop, let me show you the way.
And what did you learn from him?
What a night it has been.
Good night, friend.
And what did you do with that letter?
Why should this be so?
And then they began to fish.
But why dont you want to take it?
But take care.
But they may still come here.
Well, read the letter again.
What did he answer?
But watch over him.
Are you sure?
It was very hard.
You took it.
Do you know where he is?
He is always at it.
But it is the same with any life.
Life is all right.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
No, that can never be.
She saw no one?
Few had found it.
Let me know at once when you will start.
She is still here?
So he began to help.
Why dont you play?
We are very far from that.
Let me say one thing.
No, said her father.
Cut your hand open?
You are sure of it?
Do you want to cross?
Good for the country.
So, once more, good night.
Do you often come back?
There is only food for one.
What do you think of the music?
There were few near me.
How could you let him go so far?
Come over in the sun.
Will you never learn?
He came at once.
Let me hear your story.
Why dont you want to go?
At this time of my life, no.
Come eat with me.
Which story was it?
It was the last day of the year.
But it was very late.
Is my father here?
Let me get to work.
Who said four?
But you must never tell.
They are always the same.
Any book will tell you that.
In the country?
So take care of me.
And why should they?
Let us go in.
But it is all all too late now.
He has children of his own.
Do you have the letter?
Come here, my friend.
Call the next one.
It was like new life to him.
They dont know their own country.
Come let us see them.
what river is it?
He is at sea.
At four, she said.
One was on a white horse.
We dont see it like that.
We must go at once.
Dont you see that?
This took place at his house, in his room.
Always the same, year after year.
We might learn a thing or two.
You will answer for it.
Let me see it.
It would seem so.
No, why should he?
Here is the letter.
We should ask him.
You must never tell.
You should take me there one day.
He may come close.
And then we may begin.
He said at last.
Just set still and take it like a man.
What was the name of the man who took it?
Why do you stop here?
There was no letter for me.
Why is he cross with me?
What did he say in the letter?
And she left the room.
What is life to you?
Open the door.
Who took him out of it?
Who was the letter from?
Only, dont look back.
Where could you keep it?
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Well, let us be sure of that.
A second man got up and went out.
One of us will be here all night.
There was no answer.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
It must be in her own house.
But it would be in the paper.
Have you got it?
The children will live just the same.
No, stop.
He is my father.
Do you hear that?
Off with her head.
Always the same with you people.
It might help.
Why, it was one of his own men.
You have a car?
Still, you never know.
It was the first thing he thought of.
They may tell us to open it.
Let him grow up with you.
He had only one night more to live.
Why, dont you hear it?
Take care.
Do we stop here?
It is always so.
She never came back.
Is there any answer?
Who could have thought it?
They always know.
He could run no more.
Come at once.
We may be too late.
What do you hear?
You saw him?
Can you hear me?
But she saw no one?
Then, good night.
Watch over him.
But let us walk.
Now you must eat.
But are you sure of that?
When did you begin?
Let me go to the door.
Where is this city?
Both of us.
Who found them out?
Have you never been there?
Dont you want any?
No, never.
it took all that time to come over the water.
Here is the paper.
We got one and they got one.
What should he say?
Stop and think.
Keep to the left.
To the left.
Let me in.
Never see him again.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Have you been at sea?
Say good night.
What was left of him?
Let me look.
Are we too late?
Just a few.
It is well thought of.
Music is a good thing.
Come, let us be men.
You might want it.
Keep to the right.
Tell me more.
Let us start, then.
Well, run back to her.
He has been been found.
So it always was.
They came over last night.
Dont tell me.
He then said, It is time to start.
Ask one of those men.
Who should it be?
Let me get on with my work.
There are only four of us.
Do you know what he did last night?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
We were together.
Stop, said he.
Why, is it late?
Dont move, he said.
Write an answer.
Dont you think so?
Which end is his head?
No, dont.
She came in just now by the back door.
It is so very kind of you both.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
He might still be up.
But what did you hear?
Dont you like it?
Are we late?
For once you are right.
Point it at his horse.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
It was his own room.
You are right, father.
They never did it again.
First turn to the left.
Let him answer us.
She saw it.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Do you have a car?
Are you sure of it?
By and by he got it.
But hard to tell.
How would they stop it?
What was it that you thought?
That night we were just in time.
This is my country.
Are you my friend?
Off with his head.
How much have you got?
What a start that was.
And there are four of you?
Well, what next?
What did you hear?
Here is the book.
Watch him, he said.
Let me have a word with you.
Go to your father.
What would you have me do with my life?
It will be too late.
Let us go back.
We got to let that go.
