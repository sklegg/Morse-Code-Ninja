They told me to.
Is the wind north or south?
But she is very young.
Who was it told me his name?
She knew at once.
That was the question.
Has she any family?
The night was cold.
They knew it.
Long and the short of it.
He will leave me.
You can pass through the door.
Answer me this one question.
To know her is to love her.
Five young children.
Which king?
And how did he make his money?
Leave any for him?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
you should know her better than me.
They had heard all that before.
Hold her hand.
Now, listen.
You are right, my love.
A house is on fire?
She is very plain.
How did this happen?
We had a list.
This was true.
How soon will he be here?
But listen to me.
Now listen to me.
A young man?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
You are right, young man.
But what did we ever get for it?
You will soon know.
What size do you want?
He said, the work is now complete.
It was a round table.
Let us talk a little about my father.
How do you feel?
And you will always love him?
Your true father?
When do you leave?
Where he was, no one knew.
But he never heard me.
How short his time.
We dont know enough.
Better late than never.
That was the rule, she said.
An hour and a half.
Have you heard?
He had enough of it.
Have you a family?
They had several children.
Are they made to order?
And then he told all he knew.
What do you mean by that question?
The world is big enough.
Better cross here.
Can she sing?
No, he is a man about my size.
It can never happen.
And will you direct us?
But how simple it is.
It is the rule.
You are cold.
That must be true.
When did this happen?
Little girl, where have you been?
Where did they get the money from?
She had very little notice from him.
He had my love.
Will you answer that question?
Half as many is too much.
Are you better?
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
And so they began to talk.
She told me to ask you.
The night was cold and still.
Try it on the dog first.
It would be better if you went to the war.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
In short, take me.
Have you told her?
It is a rock.
Then get ready at once.
How do you feel now?
And dont talk to me.
One other question, said he.
In an hour?
Fire and water, earth and air.
Let me see him, said the young man.
It was true to life.
You are in love with me?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
We were up early.
Let us pass.
Before you leave, tell us.
No less, no more.
What is there to talk about?
You will always love him?
She is the first person in this house.
He got it this morning.
You must travel.
who told you you could?
What a state he was in.
So we came down this road.
you must step out.
How does this happen?
Never heard of it.
Much of it was true.
You remember the place, my father?
Light my fire.
Remember that time?
She was a good girl.
Is your family well?
So the question was, what to do?
She is fast?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Are you ready?
She told me all about it.
What have you against me now?
And so they knew that it was true.
Did he though?
If you know it, that is enough.
Is it true?
She is much better.
Do you know that old lay?
It will interest you, said he.
How does it feel?
Your watch is slow.
Do you remember him?
You have an hour.
Can you sing?
What kind of a bird?
But enough of this.
Young man, you will go far.
Pull together.
Let that pass.
And that is the whole point.
She was so young, too.
Let me also ask you a question.
Listen to me.
We must make the best of it.
Ten will be early enough.
It was all she could do to hold in.
So do you, my love.
On fire, on fire.
Made me feel so young.
That is enough.
We call it black.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
What have you heard?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Do you want any money?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
What does he feel?
He is better than any of you.
But listen to this, he said.
A better man than you.
Let us leave them, she said.
He never told us what it was she said.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Was he young or old?
He never heard.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Are you all ready?
He said, get him out of the road.
Where are you off to so early?
They had much to talk about.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
That is enough for me.
There are four hundred?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
You must leave that to me.
Keep in step.
It would have been more simple.
No, my love.
You are a good girl.
The dog is always with him.
Hold it up to the light.
That is true.
Leave me out of the question.
Are you still cold?
And serve them right.
Read them, said the King.
Why did it happen?
Better write it here.
But why must you leave me so soon?
About the usual time.
Ten, did you say?
This is my body.
Are you ready to play?
You had better go.
The King Went to him.
Ask them to sing one more song.
Had they been heard?
We are ready.
This is simple.
This will pass in no time.
Listen to this, will you?
You are on a ship?
What will happen to us?
Never heard of him.
How many children did he leave?
Never heard of it before.
He has money.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
You saw the person?
That would be the best way.
I have no children to love me.
You may go, said the King.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
It was true.
Who told you so?
Then you will know me better.
There was no wind.
It is a young girl.
What can happen?
you know better than that.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Does he love you?
Is your man white or black?
Against what side?
Did you tell him your whole story?
Have you heard from him often?
As soon as you left, it began.
Are you here on leave?
They left in the morning.
Take good care of the little girl.
Listen to them, he said.
But one day you must feel it.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
Is that true?
Let me remember what he said.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
An example would be better.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
Listen to him.
Why do we love?
We knew them both.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
What a question.
Half a mile?
He is very simple.
Who told you that?
Take notice.
It was cold.
And you are still so young.
Are we ready?
If you only knew.
It has been there ever since.
Are you in love with her?
What is love?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
You may leave the room.
Look to the west.
Does she go fast?
Can it be true?
Do you own a dog?
You love him?
Let us talk about you.
Do you remember?
She was only a little girl.
How could that happen?
We got her half way.
He put his hand over part of the map.
Let this man pass.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
She knew what was good for children.
It is true.
But let that pass.
Did you get any money?
Why do they want to make her sing?
And what does she want the money for?
You know me well enough.
Did they ever go back?
Then what would happen?
We will talk about that.
We serve them.
And why do you serve?
We had better go in.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
Why talk to me?
No more money?
Pull it more to your side.
You were told.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Do you remember me?
How far from the body?
In an hour it will be at the door.
Pass this way, then.
From then on it was war between them.
Feel better then.
That is very simple.
Leave off that.
Take a hold of it.
They are still young.
Why do you serve?
They all heard me.
Well, are you ready?
Do you love her much?
And you can sing?
He knew them.
You are better than that.
Let me hear from you soon.
Well, young man?
They can have all our half of the house.
Had you heard?
It is cold.
The rock was very small.
Put down three and carry five.
This money was for her.
It is a fire.
Every word you said was heard.
That may be true.
The family was at home.
Long live the king.
Do you love me?
What will happen now?
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
what could be better?
She must be told.
