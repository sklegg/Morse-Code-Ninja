what river is it?
But then you would be close to the sea?
Stop and think.
What country does he come from?
Always the same with you people.
Dont you want any?
Off with his head.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
it took all that time to come over the water.
So, once more, good night.
How much have you got?
Why dont you play?
She must have a hard time with him.
She is my friend.
One night more and he would be on his way.
It would seem so.
And then they began to fish.
Keep watch all night.
He is at sea.
It is so very kind of you both.
Why do you stop here?
He has been been found.
What do you think of the music?
Dont you see that?
But watch over him.
Let me see him at once.
Who can answer for that?
We must go at once.
That was the first night.
And now, good night.
Are you my friend?
How could you let him go so far?
He then said, It is time to start.
Have you got that?
We dont see it like that.
Come eat with me.
The children will live just the same.
Let me be and let me live.
Is my father here?
But take care.
There to the left.
Who was the letter from?
But now it is too late.
How would they stop it?
How could you begin?
What is your real name?
Few had found it.
Always the same, year after year.
They are hard at it.
No, why should he?
Who should it be?
She is still here?
But they may still come here.
But it is all all too late now.
A second man got up and went out.
Well, read the letter again.
What a night it has been.
It is always so.
Let her go.
But are you sure of that?
You are sure of it?
Say good night.
Why should they?
The sun had set long since.
Do you know where he is?
Let me get on with my work.
And who is this friend?
Now or never.
There was no letter for me.
At four, she said.
What would you have me do with my life?
But what did you hear?
He had two left feet.
Have you never been there?
Let me in.
He has children of his own.
Just cut it out, will you?
Open the door.
Let us cross over.
Dont you think so?
How many children?
Who did you learn that from?
This is what began it all.
But it is the same with any life.
Let me see her.
He came at once.
We must begin again.
Let me say one thing.
Have you found it?
Cut him down.
Dont say that to me.
One of us will be here all night.
You are sure of that?
We should ask him.
Will you never learn?
It is well thought of.
It was like new life to him.
Ask one of those men.
You must eat now.
Why should this be so?
It was very hard.
You must walk.
No, dont.
Give me the letter.
You must study.
What did he say in the letter?
And what did you do with that letter?
In the country?
How many are left?
Tell us a story.
Here is the letter.
Good for the country.
We may be too late.
No, never.
Our own people must come first.
Take care of him.
Who said four?
And why should they?
We should look at this.
Now let me have it.
Let him answer us.
You must never tell.
We are very far from that.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
It is open?
Do you have a car?
Which end is his head?
This took him some time.
My father is right.
What do you hear?
They always know.
But you must never tell.
Let him follow me.
First turn to the left.
Now you must eat.
Let me see it.
Was you in my room?
Is that far?
She got up.
Why, it was one of his own men.
Does he never go out?
Have you got it?
It was the first thing he thought of.
Dont move, he said.
You took it.
Do you know what he did last night?
Tell me more.
Let me know at once when you will start.
Here is the paper.
So they got out and went in.
And there are four of you?
Then let me have a word with you.
Is there any answer?
You might want it.
Why, dont you hear it?
You saw him?
But let us walk.
It was his own room.
Let me have a word with you.
What a start that was.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Is he a real father?
We might learn a thing or two.
Let us go back.
Where have you been this long while?
But hard to tell.
Let me go back.
They dont care.
We were together.
He could run no more.
He said at last.
Let me go to the door.
Let me hear your story.
Never see him again.
If you know, why dont you tell?
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Do you want some more to eat?
Sure of what?
Are we too late?
Dont tell me.
Watch over him.
She saw no one?
Where could you keep it?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
She came in just now by the back door.
These were the first people we saw.
Right here it began.
Where has she run off to?
There were few near me.
You will answer for it.
Who took him out of it?
Do you hear me?
Here we see the boy at school.
Look at his face.
Watch him, he said.
Off with her head.
You have a car?
To the left.
That is the idea.
He may come close.
Is it far?
Let us start, then.
Where is the river?
He had only one night more to live.
What was the name of the man who took it?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
We got to let that go.
She never came back.
But then it will be too late.
Are you sure?
Who could have thought it?
What did you hear?
There, do you hear?
Let him grow up with you.
No, stop.
Come over in the sun.
It is music.
So it always was.
Are you sure of it?
It was the last day of the year.
He might still be up.
What is life to you?
So he began to help.
No, that can never be.
Here is the book.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Why, is it late?
Let me see him.
Let them have it.
Tell her to begin.
Who found them out?
There is only food for one.
Are we late?
This is real.
She came over last night.
We found it.
Call the next one.
Both of us.
Music is a good thing.
She might be at his house.
He is my friend.
What should he say?
Come at once.
It will be too late.
Have you been at sea?
We never thought of that.
Let us go in.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
And then we may begin.
But it was very late.
And your children?
We got under way at last.
Well, what next?
They are always the same.
You are right, father.
No, said her father.
How did it begin?
It is a long story.
And he left the room.
Can you stand?
That night we were just in time.
Dont you like it?
Stop, let me show you the way.
Who let you in?
They may tell us to open it.
Let me get to work.
One never has too much.
You should take me there one day.
What do you think when you hear music?
He saw his men draw back.
Any book will tell you that.
Go to your father.
Good night again.
Do you know how he made his mark?
See him grow up.
By and by he got it.
Do we stop here?
Just set still and take it like a man.
It was white.
It is from your father.
Which story was it?
The other night she left.
Did you see his eye?
Let me hear what it is.
Write an answer.
Just a few.
We got one and they got one.
When did you begin?
Life is all right.
He is my father.
They came over last night.
But it would be in the paper.
And this food?
It must be in her own house.
At this time of my life, no.
Then, good night.
Cut your hand open?
Let me look.
This is my country.
Still, you never know.
Why dont you want to go?
He is always at it.
Let me out.
Only, dont look back.
What was left of him?
It was then time to start.
A call for help, you thought?
And now let us go home.
Do you want to cross?
For once you are right.
She saw it.
But she saw no one?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
No, said the Tree.
They never did it again.
And what did you learn from him?
So take care of me.
Do you often come back?
You got me?
Well, run back to her.
There was no answer.
Stop, said he.
Keep to the right.
They never come back.
Is it in the city?
Do you hear that?
And she left the room.
It might help.
One was on a white horse.
Come, let us be men.
What did he answer?
Can you hear me?
Come here, my friend.
We are together.
Take care.
Think of my father.
You found him?
Point it at his horse.
There are only four of us.
Keep to the left.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Come let us see them.
Here he is at last.
What was it that you thought?
At last we have a man.
But why dont you want to take it?
Good night, friend.
They dont know their own country.
Just cut it out.
Do you have the letter?
But you got to play music for them.
Where is this city?
Why is he cross with me?
