But then it will be too late.
Our own people must come first.
Let me get to work.
Just cut it out, will you?
Are you sure?
We never thought of that.
But what did you hear?
Keep to the left.
At last we have a man.
At four, she said.
It is open?
Look at his face.
She saw no one?
One of us will be here all night.
But it is the same with any life.
Do you know where he is?
Here he is at last.
There was no answer.
Always the same, year after year.
Tell us a story.
They are hard at it.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
It must be in her own house.
How did it begin?
One was on a white horse.
You are sure of that?
How much have you got?
Good night, friend.
Let me have a word with you.
They never did it again.
Then let me have a word with you.
Let me see it.
He has children of his own.
See him grow up.
He came at once.
Now or never.
When did you begin?
You found him?
It was very hard.
You must study.
Open the door.
Did you see his eye?
Watch over him.
We may be too late.
Well, run back to her.
What did he answer?
Do you often come back?
But now it is too late.
It was the last day of the year.
Why, dont you hear it?
You might want it.
But hard to tell.
This took him some time.
She is my friend.
This took place at his house, in his room.
No, stop.
Where have you been this long while?
They came over last night.
Let us go back.
Do you want some more to eat?
You will answer for it.
Keep to the right.
Come at once.
Is it in the city?
But watch over him.
What do you hear?
Who can answer for that?
Why should this be so?
You must eat now.
Do you hear that?
She never came back.
He is my friend.
We were together.
Still, you never know.
Let him follow me.
A second man got up and went out.
The other night she left.
How many children?
We must go at once.
What a night it has been.
Write an answer.
But are you sure of that?
In the country?
No, that can never be.
They dont know their own country.
Do you have a car?
And who is this friend?
Who was the letter from?
Have you found it?
You must walk.
What was left of him?
She saw it.
Why, it was one of his own men.
But you got to play music for them.
Stop and think.
What country does he come from?
So he began to help.
What would you have me do with my life?
Let me know at once when you will start.
Is he a real father?
Let her go.
We dont see it like that.
She must have a hard time with him.
And this food?
We got under way at last.
it took all that time to come over the water.
It was like new life to him.
Why do you stop here?
Just set still and take it like a man.
Come, let us be men.
Come let us see them.
We must begin again.
Let me hear your story.
One never has too much.
We might learn a thing or two.
You should take me there one day.
So take care of me.
He might still be up.
He had only one night more to live.
To the left.
We are very far from that.
They dont care.
And then they began to fish.
It is from your father.
Let him grow up with you.
Was you in my room?
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Let me out.
It is music.
Why dont you want to go?
Why, is it late?
She came over last night.
Are we too late?
But then you would be close to the sea?
She came in just now by the back door.
Why is he cross with me?
So they got out and went in.
They never come back.
Do we stop here?
There were few near me.
Where is the river?
What did you hear?
He saw his men draw back.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Give me the letter.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
There, do you hear?
He is my father.
Where has she run off to?
Let me see him at once.
Music is a good thing.
How many are left?
And he left the room.
Let me go to the door.
He is at sea.
No, why should he?
What was it that you thought?
Dont you see that?
Let me get on with my work.
Why dont you play?
No, said the Tree.
It would seem so.
There to the left.
How could you let him go so far?
She is still here?
Right here it began.
It is well thought of.
You must never tell.
It might help.
And what did you do with that letter?
Off with her head.
So it always was.
You took it.
Dont move, he said.
What do you think when you hear music?
Well, let us be sure of that.
No, dont.
Let me hear what it is.
And there are four of you?
Only, dont look back.
Tell her to begin.
Dont you want any?
Let me in.
Then, good night.
Few had found it.
And your children?
That night we were just in time.
Good for the country.
We are together.
Never see him again.
Why should they?
Do you know what he did last night?
Stop, let me show you the way.
They are always the same.
Are you sure of it?
You are right, father.
This is my country.
Say good night.
Well, read the letter again.
It was then time to start.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
For once you are right.
Which story was it?
You are sure of it?
It is always so.
The sun had set long since.
Cut your hand open?
These were the first people we saw.
Let me say one thing.
Keep watch all night.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Is that far?
Let us go in.
But let us walk.
Now you must eat.
Here is the book.
Do you hear me?
Have you been at sea?
There are only four of us.
Both of us.
By and by he got it.
Sure of what?
So, once more, good night.
Think of my father.
what river is it?
Take care.
What was the name of the man who took it?
Have you never been there?
No, never.
Do you have the letter?
Dont you think so?
A call for help, you thought?
Come over in the sun.
The children will live just the same.
Point it at his horse.
What is life to you?
If you know, why dont you tell?
Dont tell me.
How could you begin?
Who let you in?
And why should they?
And now let us go home.
But they may still come here.
Stop, said he.
Well, what next?
Watch him, he said.
Let me go back.
That is the idea.
We should ask him.
They always know.
He has been been found.
Let me be and let me live.
Who said four?
We got to let that go.
It is so very kind of you both.
That was the first night.
Life is all right.
First turn to the left.
It is a long story.
Is my father here?
He may come close.
Let me see her.
We got one and they got one.
Cut him down.
What should he say?
Can you hear me?
Come here, my friend.
Ask one of those men.
Take care of him.
Here we see the boy at school.
This is what began it all.
What is your real name?
Go to your father.
You saw him?
It was white.
Let him answer us.
Call the next one.
Where is this city?
What a start that was.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
My father is right.
He could run no more.
How would they stop it?
She might be at his house.
But why dont you want to take it?
He then said, It is time to start.
Off with his head.
Is it far?
Have you got it?
And now, good night.
Is there any answer?
What do you think of the music?
Just a few.
Dont you like it?
Here is the paper.
Who could have thought it?
But it was very late.
Just cut it out.
Do you know how he made his mark?
But she saw no one?
At this time of my life, no.
Let us start, then.
Who did you learn that from?
Let them have it.
She got up.
There is only food for one.
There was no letter for me.
No, said her father.
Any book will tell you that.
Let me see him.
They may tell us to open it.
Have you got that?
Which end is his head?
Where could you keep it?
Come eat with me.
And what did you learn from him?
Let us cross over.
But it is all all too late now.
Who took him out of it?
Does he never go out?
Dont say that to me.
You got me?
Are we late?
Here is the letter.
Can you stand?
And then we may begin.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Tell me more.
He said at last.
Will you never learn?
We found it.
And she left the room.
But you must never tell.
It was his own room.
Who found them out?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Always the same with you people.
Let me look.
He had two left feet.
Who should it be?
But it would be in the paper.
But take care.
We should look at this.
What did he say in the letter?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Are you my friend?
Do you want to cross?
You have a car?
Good night again.
Now let me have it.
This is real.
He is always at it.
It will be too late.
