Then he must be a wonder.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Then all was dark again.
Did she stay long?
My mind is made up.
Behind my bed.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Wait a minute.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
It is possible.
She got her hand free.
But that is nothing to us.
Quick, friend, quick.
He was here a minute ago.
Wait for me here, all of you.
It is certain.
Nothing could have been better.
And yet you are the better off?
How was it done?
Dont laugh.
And then the game began all over again.
It might have done me good.
Wonder if he has a name.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Money is power.
Oh, dont ask me.
Sit down, said the old man.
Then lead the way.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
At his side was a large green box.
This made him wonder more and more.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
But it must be done soon.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
You brought no one with you?
Why did you bring him here?
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
This voice was that of my father.
Half the town was there.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
What more is to be done?
Nothing at all.
See what you have done.
How can a little dog laugh?
Stay where you are.
And he told you nothing?
What has brought you here?
He began to laugh.
Your voice is that of a young man.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Is that a fact?
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Go in there and drive them out.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Is it possible?
Oh, this is too much.
He is among us.
The night was dark.
Yes, go on.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
Oh, do you know?
Of course they will.
Yes, he said.
Do you have my note?
Bring it here.
It is nothing.
Did she fall?
Yes, but what did she say?
It is his voice.
It was so very long ago.
Clear my name.
Can it be possible?
It was a warm night.
That was well done.
Oh, man.
He had made up his mind.
You know nothing about it.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Well, sit down.
It was a record run.
Yes, there it is.
He knew nothing.
The island was a mile long.
and so he decide he go back home.
It is a real bed.
How long ago?
They need a rest.
Oh, but you were there?
Is that possible?
You are in my power.
Yes, all right.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Who brought you up?
Leave the rest to me.
Look at that dark water.
It is done.
It was so long ago.
is it come yet?
And yet you said he had money.
We are more strong together.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Is he in bed?
We must be quick.
Play the game out.
The whole day had been hot.
The water ran dry.
How was that possible?
That is possible.
Oh, that is very simple.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
It was a cold, dark night.
It stood behind the door.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Oh, he is so kind.
Yes, you are right.
The night was very dark.
There is a lot of people.
Of course it might.
Well, there he stood.
Yes, my love?
Now we must wait.
What have they done?
What did the letter contain?
He brought it with him for us to see.
What kind of voice is it?
Well, but where can he fly to?
It must be done at once.
How long would you keep me in town?
Oh, all right.
If only they would be quick.
Try to sleep.
Clear the way.
Well, miss?
Oh, tell me.
Sit down, he said.
Yes, very well.
Well, what about my plan?
Well then, be quick.
Never mind that.
A fine thing too.
Yes, we know that.
Oh, that.
This is a test.
But never mind that.
His plan is very simple.
Let him go free?
We are free to act and think.
They all fall to the ground.
Go and rest.
He stood up.
They call him a fine boy.
But she is nothing to me now.
There is nothing more to be said.
And here is the note.
Keep clear of him.
Why should my father fly?
Did it all rest on me?
Yes, it is true.
Oh, do the best you can.
Bring them here.
Yes, he did.
Oh, nothing.
It is time for bed.
You must have a rest.
She heard and saw nothing.
All right then, sit down.
Nothing is more simple.
Why, of course.
Will you rest here a little?
You must stay with me.
Where can you wait for me?
All that for nothing?
They would cry.
He ran up to them.
Bring this with you.
Fly, my friend.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Yes, she said.
It was done.
Nothing had come of it.
He saw nothing.
What have you done?
Oh, take those off.
You know you must say yes.
Better sit still.
You are free to do so.
Yes, and no.
She was still game.
He gave me this paper.
He never said nothing.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
You must stay.
Yes, she was back.
What can be done?
Come quick.
In that town there is a street.
Well, sit down by me.
My mind was soon made up.
She began to cry.
That would be a fine thing.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
He will sleep an hour.
Oh, to be sure.
Take good note of it.
What is done is done.
Do you see that island?
Yes, sit down.
Nothing new under the sun.
Never mind me.
You love a certain person.
Let me see your plan.
There is no possible way.
He had, to be sure, done much.
There, by the wheel.
Oh, if men only knew.
It is very clear.
Yes, she could sing that.
He must be in the same boat as us.
What have they done with my work?
And you can do nothing until then?
Be quick, for the time is short.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Are you strong?
All of this was possible.
Yes, it did.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Just go to sleep.
The old man gave no answer.
But what must be done?
Answer me that, miss.
It was cold and dark.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Let her wait.
Nothing she can eat?
It was very dark.
He must wait.
Like these in shape and size?
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Wait a second.
Oh, just listen.
Help me sit up.
Come, and we can rest together.
Go back to bed.
Yes, of course.
Perhaps he did.
Yes, once.
Very well, wait a minute.
It was brought to me.
Lead me to him.
And what a voice she has.
Yes, that is true.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Come, let me show you my plan.
You knew it, and said nothing?
It was a kind of language between us.
Get to bed.
Wonder is it like that.
Just let us go free.
Of course it is.
Then it is certain?
Hold on a minute.
Good to rest once in a way.
Be back in a minute.
Fine, very fine.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
There is your old bed.
But what then must be done?
I hear his voice in the house.
But they could see nothing.
Oh, take me with you.
It was right in front of us.
His first cry was for his father.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Yes, but only for you and me.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Nothing could be more simple.
Again came the voice.
Yes, go and find out.
She gave me her hand.
And sit in the dark?
It was hot.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Yes, said the old man.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Who gave it to you?
Which box do you mean?
Is my father in town?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
He left long ago.
What brought you here?
And what have you done to me?
All was dark.
There was more to be done.
Oh, you are there.
Yes, what is it?
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Oh, very well, he said.
It must be done.
It was full of people.
Yes and no.
But let us see your plan.
Laugh, if you will.
Yes, to be sure.
No, nothing at all.
It was a very dark night.
Is it certain?
Do you talk in your sleep?
Oh, do as you like.
They know nothing about it.
Oh, come now.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
In a minute.
He has a good voice still.
That is a fact.
Decide if you are going back home.
Well, of course.
But how long ago?
It is all done.
Oh, no.
Oh, of course.
Wait for me.
Oh let me in.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Money is no object?
His will be done.
Of course she will.
You better stay here all night.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Are they on foot?
He is in the box.
The snow is deep.
Here is our plan.
What is power?
Her voice was low.
What age is he?
Wonder what he does.
Free to do what?
Of course he was right.
Behind every book is a man.
Never mind how he came here.
Well yes, you are right.
What a game.
Did he fall?
Clear the table.
It has to be done.
How is that done?
You can sleep here.
Oh, go on.
The city was soon behind me.
But wait a minute.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Let us sit down.
Then bring them to me, she said.
You can hear that, miss?
It is no use, said a voice.
You will fall.
Well, what does that lead up to?
It was a dark night.
We brought them in.
No, nothing of the kind.
Wait and see.
What has he done?
It was a long time before she could sleep.
