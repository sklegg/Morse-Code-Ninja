But are you sure of that?
There, do you hear?
It is always so.
Where have you been this long while?
But let us walk.
Who could have thought it?
Who took him out of it?
So, once more, good night.
Why, is it late?
Cut your hand open?
You got me?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
It is so very kind of you both.
Music is a good thing.
Tell me more.
Keep watch all night.
This took place at his house, in his room.
We should ask him.
One night more and he would be on his way.
They always know.
These were the first people we saw.
In the country?
What was left of him?
There was no answer.
They never did it again.
She came over last night.
Do you hear me?
You have a car?
Let me know at once when you will start.
What do you hear?
So it always was.
Let us go back.
What is your real name?
Dont move, he said.
And there are four of you?
A second man got up and went out.
They came over last night.
Who said four?
Still, you never know.
Few had found it.
Here is the paper.
Sure of what?
My father is right.
And now let us go home.
That night we were just in time.
That was the first night.
By and by he got it.
How did it begin?
Have you been at sea?
You found him?
No, dont.
Never see him again.
What country does he come from?
Cut him down.
Then, good night.
Just cut it out.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
It will be too late.
We should look at this.
Is that far?
Only, dont look back.
You should take me there one day.
First turn to the left.
You are right, father.
We must go at once.
He saw his men draw back.
But they may still come here.
Do you want to cross?
Take care.
It was very hard.
And what did you learn from him?
Where is this city?
You might want it.
Take care of him.
Why dont you want to go?
And why should they?
Did you see his eye?
To the left.
Keep to the right.
You took it.
Who was the letter from?
We may be too late.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Was you in my room?
This is my country.
And she left the room.
She saw no one?
Are you sure?
Our own people must come first.
How much have you got?
It was the last day of the year.
Always the same with you people.
He could run no more.
And then they began to fish.
It is well thought of.
Any book will tell you that.
You are sure of it?
Why, dont you hear it?
This took him some time.
But now it is too late.
Let me see her.
And this food?
What do you think when you hear music?
He had only one night more to live.
Can you stand?
So they got out and went in.
No, never.
Do you know where he is?
Then let me have a word with you.
No, said the Tree.
He might still be up.
He has been been found.
And your children?
We got to let that go.
Let me go back.
Are we too late?
Do you want some more to eat?
At last we have a man.
What should he say?
Here is the letter.
No, said her father.
Why dont you play?
She is my friend.
Call the next one.
You saw him?
Is my father here?
Dont you think so?
Stop and think.
Where could you keep it?
Do you have a car?
She might be at his house.
See him grow up.
They dont care.
Ask one of those men.
When did you begin?
At four, she said.
Just a few.
They dont know their own country.
It might help.
There are only four of us.
It is music.
Dont say that to me.
Say good night.
And then we may begin.
We must begin again.
Are you my friend?
Let me hear what it is.
You are sure of that?
No, why should he?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Where has she run off to?
Here we see the boy at school.
What a start that was.
So take care of me.
What did he answer?
But it was very late.
Go to your father.
Always the same, year after year.
Now you must eat.
But hard to tell.
Here he is at last.
Why, it was one of his own men.
Give me the letter.
You will answer for it.
What do you think of the music?
We got under way at last.
You must never tell.
Is there any answer?
You must eat now.
What would you have me do with my life?
Do you know how he made his mark?
Let me go to the door.
He may come close.
He said at last.
But then it will be too late.
They are always the same.
it took all that time to come over the water.
Let her go.
Let us go in.
We were together.
But why dont you want to take it?
There to the left.
He has children of his own.
But watch over him.
But she saw no one?
How many are left?
Well, what next?
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Do you know what he did last night?
Why should this be so?
What a night it has been.
But it is all all too late now.
Now let me have it.
Let them have it.
Let me in.
Let me see it.
Why is he cross with me?
There is only food for one.
Watch him, he said.
Let him grow up with you.
Let me get to work.
How could you begin?
But what did you hear?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
There were few near me.
Does he never go out?
What was the name of the man who took it?
Have you got that?
And he left the room.
Let me have a word with you.
Come here, my friend.
And who is this friend?
How could you let him go so far?
Come eat with me.
Let us cross over.
Do you hear that?
But you must never tell.
Watch over him.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Have you found it?
Keep to the left.
That is the idea.
Good for the country.
Good night again.
How would they stop it?
They may tell us to open it.
Do we stop here?
Stop, said he.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Do you have the letter?
They are hard at it.
Come let us see them.
But you got to play music for them.
He then said, It is time to start.
It is a long story.
No, that can never be.
Who can answer for that?
Tell her to begin.
Stop, let me show you the way.
The other night she left.
One never has too much.
Both of us.
We got one and they got one.
The sun had set long since.
Let me hear your story.
We never thought of that.
We dont see it like that.
Dont you want any?
It would seem so.
Why should they?
You must study.
This is real.
For once you are right.
Good night, friend.
Life is all right.
Look at his face.
We are very far from that.
Do you often come back?
Let me see him.
Open the door.
It was white.
what river is it?
Let me look.
Think of my father.
Right here it began.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Will you never learn?
Now or never.
And what did you do with that letter?
He had two left feet.
It was his own room.
Off with his head.
There was no letter for me.
She got up.
She saw it.
Is it in the city?
Can you hear me?
Dont tell me.
Let me say one thing.
Who did you learn that from?
And now, good night.
Tell us a story.
We found it.
Let us start, then.
Is it far?
He is my father.
Well, run back to her.
What did you hear?
Dont you see that?
It must be in her own house.
What is life to you?
We are together.
Come at once.
So he began to help.
But it is the same with any life.
One of us will be here all night.
She came in just now by the back door.
She must have a hard time with him.
She never came back.
Let me be and let me live.
Let me out.
A call for help, you thought?
Off with her head.
But then you would be close to the sea?
Have you never been there?
He is always at it.
They never come back.
Are you sure of it?
This is what began it all.
Who should it be?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Let him answer us.
But take care.
Well, read the letter again.
It is open?
How many children?
Let him follow me.
Dont you like it?
Is he a real father?
Here is the book.
Have you got it?
Which story was it?
Where is the river?
Just set still and take it like a man.
You must walk.
Who found them out?
Point it at his horse.
Come over in the sun.
It was then time to start.
Let me see him at once.
Come, let us be men.
One was on a white horse.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Who let you in?
She is still here?
At this time of my life, no.
Just cut it out, will you?
Which end is his head?
We might learn a thing or two.
The children will live just the same.
But it would be in the paper.
Why do you stop here?
He is my friend.
He is at sea.
It is from your father.
Let me get on with my work.
He came at once.
What was it that you thought?
What did he say in the letter?
Are we late?
It was like new life to him.
No, stop.
Write an answer.
