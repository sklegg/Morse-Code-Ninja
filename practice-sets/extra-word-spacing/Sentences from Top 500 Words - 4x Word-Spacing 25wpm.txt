is it come yet?
That was well done.
Yes and no.
Nothing new under the sun.
Oh, you are there.
Oh, that.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Do you see that island?
You know nothing about it.
Is my father in town?
All right then, sit down.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
What a game.
He ran up to them.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Yes, she was back.
It was hot.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Yes, she said.
He left long ago.
Did it all rest on me?
You can hear that, miss?
There is no one in that room behind you.
Be quick, for the time is short.
It must be done at once.
Well, what about my plan?
You could see there was a story behind it.
Then bring them to me, she said.
What have you done?
What more is to be done?
Let her wait.
Then lead the way.
Wait and see.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
Oh, tell me.
He saw nothing.
Yes, she could sing that.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Oh, but you were there?
The night was dark.
But let us see your plan.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
What brought you here?
Go and rest.
Take good note of it.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
All was dark.
Yes, what is it?
Get to bed.
If only they would be quick.
It was a cold, dark night.
Never mind how he came here.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Just go to sleep.
Why did you bring him here?
We must be quick.
You better stay here all night.
Yes, but what did she say?
He began to laugh.
There is nothing more to be said.
Do you have my note?
It was full of people.
The city was soon behind me.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
How was that possible?
Hold on a minute.
You knew it, and said nothing?
How is that done?
Oh, come now.
But she is nothing to me now.
You must have a rest.
Well, miss?
He must be in the same boat as us.
Be back in a minute.
You will fall.
Answer me that, miss.
But wait a minute.
It is all done.
Why should my father fly?
Never mind me.
How was it done?
See what you have done.
Yes, all right.
It was cold and dark.
And what have you done to me?
She heard and saw nothing.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Well then, be quick.
Of course she will.
Go in there and drive them out.
How long ago?
Look at that dark water.
There, by the wheel.
Is he in bed?
Then he must be a wonder.
And you can do nothing until then?
Never mind that.
Oh, this is too much.
Is it possible?
They all fall to the ground.
Then it is certain?
It is a real bed.
It was so very long ago.
Nothing she can eat?
We are free to act and think.
Did she stay long?
She could think of nothing more to say.
Of course it is.
Yes, sit down.
Come, and we can rest together.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Try to sleep.
There is a lot of people.
It is very clear.
Oh, no.
Oh, that is very simple.
Like these in shape and size?
Wait a second.
Let him go free?
Yes, it is true.
She got her hand free.
Yes, go on.
No, nothing at all.
Well, sit down by me.
And yet you are the better off?
What is done is done.
Where can you wait for me?
Yes, it did.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Good to rest once in a way.
How long would you keep me in town?
He was here a minute ago.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
He is among us.
All that for nothing?
Yes, he did.
Oh, do the best you can.
You are in my power.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Clear the way.
Did he fall?
It was a kind of language between us.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Come, let me show you my plan.
And yet you said he had money.
Well, there he stood.
What age is he?
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Wonder what he does.
What has brought you here?
He never said nothing.
A fine thing too.
Well, what does that lead up to?
He gave me this paper.
You must stay with me.
He had made up his mind.
That is possible.
It was a warm night.
Yes, go and find out.
Yes, of course.
The old man gave no answer.
Better sit still.
Wait for me here, all of you.
This made him wonder more and more.
His will be done.
Oh, all right.
Oh, take those off.
Just let us go free.
What can be done?
It was so long ago.
What did the letter contain?
They know nothing about it.
Nothing had come of it.
Are they on foot?
Help me sit up.
And here is the note.
Dont laugh.
He brought it with him for us to see.
It is possible.
He must wait.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Why, of course.
The water ran dry.
She was still game.
Behind every book is a man.
How can a little dog laugh?
But they could see nothing.
Who gave it to you?
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
This voice was that of my father.
His first cry was for his father.
Decide if you are going back home.
He will sleep an hour.
Did she fall?
Wonder if he has a name.
In a minute.
My mind was soon made up.
Oh, do as you like.
Yes, you are right.
Sit down, said the old man.
But it must be done soon.
There is no possible way.
Oh, take me with you.
Will you rest here a little?
Is that possible?
Oh let me in.
Money is no object?
They would cry.
Yes, he said.
My mind is made up.
Money is power.
We brought them in.
Are you strong?
There was more to be done.
Here is our plan.
It might have done me good.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
It was brought to me.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Yes, once.
Oh, he is so kind.
The night was very dark.
Oh, how can you sleep?
In that town there is a street.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Clear my name.
He is in the box.
Which box do you mean?
It was a record run.
Clear the table.
It is time for bed.
Wonder is it like that.
Well, sit down.
There is your old bed.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
What has he done?
You know you must say yes.
That is a fact.
Well, of course.
Let us sit down.
Yes, and no.
It must be done.
I hear his voice in the house.
And sit in the dark?
It has to be done.
But that is nothing to us.
Oh, dont ask me.
Bring this with you.
Yes, my love?
No, nothing of the kind.
All of this was possible.
The snow is deep.
Oh, very well, he said.
Very well, wait a minute.
Bring it here.
Then all was dark again.
Yes, we know that.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Nothing could have been better.
Lead me to him.
What is power?
Yes, there it is.
Free to do what?
Go back to bed.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Nothing at all.
Is it certain?
Yes, said the old man.
Wait a minute.
Do you talk in your sleep?
The whole day had been hot.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
What kind of voice is it?
Yes, very well.
Nothing could be more simple.
Of course he was right.
Oh, to be sure.
At his side was a large green box.
They need a rest.
Yes, that is true.
They call him a fine boy.
Oh, if men only knew.
It was a very dark night.
He stood up.
Sit down, he said.
It was right in front of us.
Well yes, you are right.
But what then must be done?
It was a dark night.
Behind my bed.
She gave me her hand.
Perhaps he did.
The island was a mile long.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
It is his voice.
She began to cry.
Oh, nothing.
But how long ago?
She got up, and ran out of the room.
It was done.
Oh, man.
Oh, do you know?
Bring them here.
Stay where you are.
Leave the rest to me.
It stood behind the door.
Come quick.
Oh, go on.
Play the game out.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Can it be possible?
and so he decide he go back home.
You love a certain person.
Quick, friend, quick.
Of course it might.
We are more strong together.
Her voice was low.
That would be a fine thing.
Fly, my friend.
His plan is very simple.
Oh, just listen.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
This is a test.
Nothing is more simple.
He knew nothing.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Let me see your plan.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Is that a fact?
It is no use, said a voice.
Oh, of course.
Half the town was there.
You brought no one with you?
Yes, but only for you and me.
What have they done with my work?
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Of course they will.
And then the game began all over again.
But what must be done?
You are free to do so.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
You must stay.
You can sleep here.
Who brought you up?
Fine, very fine.
Now we must wait.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
It is done.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Wait for me.
But never mind that.
Your voice is that of a young man.
It is certain.
Yes, to be sure.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Laugh, if you will.
It is nothing.
He has a good voice still.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
It was very dark.
Keep clear of him.
Again came the voice.
And what a voice she has.
Yes, he said, all of it.
What have they done?
And he told you nothing?
