No, tell me.
Where are we to turn for help?
Why do you want to know?
In what part of the house?
Is this the man?
Where are we?
Where did you place it?
Well, and what do you think?
She has been with him many long years.
Hand it in.
Did you tell him?
No, mother.
And what will they do with us?
Is it all right?
What was it you said to me?
Why did he come?
To what end?
When will her mother come?
Is there no one who can help me?
And what did he say?
You are all very kind to me.
Is that all you want?
Who will tell her?
It is great.
Now we see the light.
It is very high.
This for me?
The first act was over.
And where is this man?
Say what you want.
But why do you ask me?
It was high time.
Show me the way.
After three, he said.
Tell us all about it.
Where did he come from?
He said too much.
Is there some for me?
Give me my work.
Get out and play.
Where have they been?
How can you say that?
Now, what do you want with me?
Do you think so now?
Call me what you will, he said.
It is the same thing.
It is all the same.
There, that does me good.
Too much in the way.
Then what kind is it?
Here it is.
This is the man.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Are you here for good?
That is all one can say about her.
What was his name?
Well, tell me.
You must tell me.
They had all been very good to us.
How did you get here?
You know, you see right through people.
Is he a good man?
There is more to tell.
Good day, one and all.
He has more to give.
Show me the way he went.
That is just my point.
Now tell me.
How on earth do you know?
That was a good time.
We will say no more about it, then.
There is the little boy.
Say no more.
That would be very good.
There is no place like home.
Why are you here?
Well, read it.
And who is the man?
It will take a little time.
She has a house?
You can help me here.
Ask him to show up?
Get to work.
where did she come from?
What do you play?
Well, how are you?
Put it on.
This is the first act.
Very well, show him to me.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
All right, then.
Is it any good?
What does it all mean?
Why do you want water?
Well then, tell him so.
Is it as good now?
Well, what do you think?
Give it me.
It must be where you put it.
And off we go.
She went on.
There was no one near.
She came up to them.
That was a house to look at.
Do you know me?
What do you want to ask these people?
Who are these men?
But you must.
Such as what?
She had to tell him.
And why is that?
What would you have me do?
Then why are you here?
How does he use it?
You think so, too?
How much do you want?
Good day to you.
It is very kind of you.
Is it you or me?
Here is the way we put in the time.
Now come here.
What you have just said is good, very good.
Do you want me to do it?
What do they want?
Too much for me now.
Where in the world did you come from?
He was so kind.
How do you take it?
But he is right.
She was the cause of it all.
But what about me?
Now, go home.
And how in the world did you find them?
Move on, then.
All in good time.
But where is it?
How much are they?
But why do you ask?
Well, here he is.
Can you help me find my way?
Where to, now?
He was here.
And how did you find out?
Read that, he said.
Much good that would be.
Do it for me.
It would be very kind of you.
Think what you will.
Give me your hand.
Why is he here?
Tell me about it.
Where have you been?
Just look at her.
And how old were you at that time?
Play with them.
Three, he said.
The world is before you.
You will get on in the world.
They want more.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Come with me, then.
Very well then.
Now, you know me.
Here it is, he said.
Now it was time to act.
That is the end of her.
What will each of you give?
What have you been after?
What did you say that for?
And that was the end of it.
When will he come back?
Do you think so?
How did you get me out?
What does he mean?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
But who was your mother?
How could she say such a thing.
Is it large?
How does she use you?
Where is he now?
Give me more than that
What do you want me to do?
Where is he?
And where is he now?
There will just be time.
You are right.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Been back long?
What did you say your name was?
At your house?
And what was his name?
We are here.
He will live.
Go and try.
Tell us your name.
How old are you?
I would like to see her again in that.
He went to him.
For some man.
What could set you off in the first place?
Come and help me.
Where do you live?
How can you tell?
Where are you off to?
Have you been here long?
Do you think she was?
And where is it?
there are only two.
Think of him.
Is he big?
Will you come with me?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Where are you from?
We must come back.
See, here it is.
And have you been here long?
He was there too.
What on earth do you mean?
What did he tell you?
And what did she say?
Look at me.
He said that that would help.
Here she is.
What is his name?
And what are they made of?
Who is that man?
That is right, said the old man.
Which house is it?
Then will come our time.
When will it take place?
Show it to me.
How did that help you?
Think it over.
Well then, what do you want?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Are you at it again?
Only two there now.
Come with me.
Would you now like to look round my place?
Tell me who made the world.
Very well, he said.
Turn this way.
What does one live for?
And a very good thing, too.
do you come from the end of the world?
You see it every day.
Come with me to the little house.
One, two, three.
Well, and is that all?
Well, all right.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Then they will follow you?
What did he say?
You must come now.
Some day you may ask me about it.
Read that, she said.
If you want to know, go and find out.
There is no one here to see.
He was at work again.
And where was the place?
But where are we to go?
But what does it mean?
How old was she?
What a good thing it would be.
What is that in your hand?
Why, what is it, then?
Too much of this.
But it is just so with the world.
Just look through it.
That was very good.
Get out of the way.
What more could a man ask for?
This is my point.
What is your name?
He went on his way.
How can you find out?
Where could he be?
Time to get out.
And what about your mother?
You are a good boy.
Are you back again?
You think so?
And where is she, then?
We are who we say we are.
You must take me with you.
And what do you think?
Good, he said.
Well, go on.
What on earth does this mean?
Take some, she said.
You were near him.
What is in your hand?
Where are they off to now?
this one, too?
Why is that?
What do you want?
Well, how did it go?
In what year?
Is she well?
See, they are here.
She was right.
Can you take me?
And what is her name?
What could she mean by it?
Tell me all about it.
What do you mean?
What will you say?
Is that right?
Now where did they come from?
Will you try?
Were you here before me?
And it did me good.
There was work to do.
But what did you want?
Tell me his name.
Why, what do you mean?
What does she think about me?
Ask her, he said.
Where do they get that?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Give him air.
There she is again.
Say no more about it.
But where is he?
Large or small?
take them all.
For how much?
And in she went.
Take this and this.
Well, did he?
Look at it other way round.
They are here.
Try it on.
You are most kind.
Why are they here?
Give it to me, then.
Can you point it out to me?
But this is the point.
Are they like each other?
Well, what do you think about it?
He will ask for it.
Think no more about that.
How long have you been here?
What do they say was the cause?
Follow me, said the man.
And they went home.
What do you mean by that?
Give me a light.
But he does so need a mother.
Here is my hand.
What do you think of him?
What does all this mean?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
What do you think of her?
What do you think of this?
How can you think of such a thing?
And do you know why?
Why are you like this?
Where is she?
What does she want?
Just like me.
What do you think of that?
That is right.
Will you take me to her?
Where does he live?
Where are you?
You can say what it is.
He is at my house.
