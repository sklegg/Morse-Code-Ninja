How is he?
When was it?
How was that?
What are you up to?
What do you make of it?
Look at it this way.
And all for what?
And what did you see?
Come this way.
But so it is.
Did you know her?
Do you know?
But what is it?
Has it come to this?
What would she have said?
Which is it?
What could it be?
Look over it.
Then, how do you know?
What did they do?
We have no water.
Who was he?
Do you see it?
What DO you know of him?
But he had no time.
So it was.
What do you make of that?
And how did you find out?
Call him in.
That is a long time.
How is he now?
Is it time?
We have him.
Do as you will.
who, then, are you?
How did he do it?
What other way is there to look at it?
What is there to see?
So be it.
Look at them.
That was all she said.
Did you see it?
What was it about?
What is that?
Now you know.
But it has been so long.
How long has he been there?
And what is that?
When is it?
The time will come.
What have you come for?
Can you do that?
You can go.
So it is.
How did you know about it?
It was from you.
You have it.
Who and what are you?
Are you there?
Who was that?
Is he there?
Tqhen you may go.
There you are.
But will he see it?
Can it be?
Is that it?
and so on, and so on.
There is but one thing to do.
Do you know what you look like?
But what will you do?
Now what are we to do with you?
And who was that?
Do they know him?
Will you come and see her?
And what was it for?
You know more than we do.
Did you know him?
How would you like to have it?
what is it?
Then how many are there?
Who are you?
Then what are you up to now?
but there was more to it than this.
What was it?
Do you know him?
There they are.
Then there is more to do.
Do as you like.
Do you see him?
What is he like?
And what did you do then?
Is it like him?
He said no.
One or two?
What time is it?
Then who are you?
You may go.
What can this be?
No one will come, she said.
Would you like some?
That will do, he said.
What will you do, then?
Do you like him?
Is it over?
You have them?
There he is, do you see him?
Then what is it?
Do you know her?
What is it for?
who can it be?
But he had to have it.
The time had come.
That will do, said he.
But it was of no use.
No was there one?
what has she to do with it?
But what have they been up to?
And do you like her?
What did you do then?
But when will that be?
What is all this?
Now there is no more to be said.
Can one see from there?
That is what she did.
And what do you call her?
are you there?
But WHAT DID you see?
May we come in?
And what do you make of it?
What do you see?
You can have some.
At what time?
How did she do it?
How did you come by it?
Go on, he said.
So there it was.
Who is she?
And do you like him?
Look at it.
And who is this?
And is that all?
But what are you up to?
There he is, she said.
So that was the way.
Did you know them?
When was that?
How can you know?
What is it like?
but what if it is?
They said no more.
That was it.
And has it come to this?
Is that her?
Who will go first?
How is she?
Do you know what it is?
At what number?
How are you?
What did he do to you?
She has it.
Had to look the other way.
Then make it up.
What is it all about?
You know how it is with her.
Now is your time.
You can do it.
What do they call you?
What is it about?
How can it be?
Look at him.
Or so they said.
Would you do what he did?
And who are you?
There you are, he said.
Out of the way.
There he is, you see.
What are we to do?
Is she like him?
There were two of them.
But how about you?
But who was she?
Did you see her?
And when will you call?
but we can go and see.
Will that do?
How do you do?
And could she see him?
Is that all?
But how is that?
What can we do, then?
What was he like?
How did he do it?
Or so they said.
May we come in?
What do you make of it?
Is she like him?
what has she to do with it?
But it has been so long.
Look at him.
You have it.
What is that?
And when will you call?
They said no more.
What could it be?
At what number?
And has it come to this?
When is it?
Look at it this way.
Did you know him?
You may go.
Then what are you up to now?
What is it for?
It was from you.
And who are you?
but we can go and see.
What is it all about?
How did you know about it?
But what have they been up to?
Do you know him?
Do as you like.
Now there is no more to be said.
And what was it for?
But who was she?
Then how many are there?
And who is this?
And who was that?
Did you see it?
No was there one?
There he is, do you see him?
Can it be?
Who was that?
There you are, he said.
Who was he?
Out of the way.
So it was.
You can go.
Has it come to this?
Is that all?
You know more than we do.
How is he?
Do you see him?
How would you like to have it?

Who are you?
There you are.
You can have some.
But he had to have it.
What can this be?
What did they do?
What is it about?
Did you know them?
And what do you call her?
Is that her?
Will that do?
Had to look the other way.
That was all she said.
But WHAT DID you see?
But how about you?
What can we do, then?
What are we to do?
What did he do to you?
What is there to see?
Can one see from there?
Do you like him?
Then, how do you know?
What is he like?
Is that it?
Go on, he said.
Do as you will.
There were two of them.
Would you like some?
That will do, he said.
But he had no time.
How is he now?
Come this way.
Then make it up.
Now you know.
What is it like?
How long has he been there?
Look at it.
Do you know?
What other way is there to look at it?
He said no.
And what did you see?
Do they know him?
You know how it is with her.
How was that?
And what did you do then?
But what is it?
No one will come, she said.
So be it.
are you there?

And do you like her?
So that was the way.
She has it.
Look over it.
Do you see it?
Would you do what he did?
What was he like?
That will do, said he.
What do you see?
What time is it?
How did you come by it?
What will you do, then?
We have him.
Who will go first?
But when will that be?
At what time?
Call him in.
You can do it.
Do you know her?
Did you see her?
Now is your time.
And do you like him?

Look at them.
So it is.
We have no water.
How can you know?
Can you do that?
That is what she did.
But what are you up to?
