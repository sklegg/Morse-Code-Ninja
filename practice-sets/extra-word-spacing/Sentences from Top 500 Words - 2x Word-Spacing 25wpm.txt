You could see there was a story behind it.
Nothing is more simple.
It was full of people.
What has he done?
Clear my name.
Yes, all right.
No, nothing at all.
Do you have my note?
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
His plan is very simple.
It was very dark.
Wait a minute.
They would cry.
Perhaps he did.
It stood behind the door.
Nothing could have been better.
You can hear that, miss?
Then he must be a wonder.
Oh, that is very simple.
Nothing at all.
Like these in shape and size?
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Just let us go free.
What did the letter contain?
All was dark.
She gave me her hand.
Then bring them to me, she said.
It was right in front of us.
What kind of voice is it?
But what must be done?
It is a real bed.
He left long ago.
It was a record run.
Play the game out.
We are more strong together.
We brought them in.
Then lead the way.
Wonder is it like that.
The night was dark.
Try to sleep.
Did it all rest on me?
Who brought you up?
There is your old bed.
That was well done.
How is that done?
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Yes, of course.
It is his voice.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
It was a dark night.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Yes, go on.
Yes, it did.
This voice was that of my father.
Yes, what is it?
Go back to bed.
Oh, tell me.
Well, sit down.
Why should my father fly?
You must have a rest.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Money is no object?
Quick, friend, quick.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Well, what does that lead up to?
He began to laugh.
Fly, my friend.
Sit down, said the old man.
And you can do nothing until then?
But she is nothing to me now.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Well yes, you are right.
Better sit still.
Well, sit down by me.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Very well, wait a minute.
Are they on foot?
There is a lot of people.
Yes, he said.
It was a cold, dark night.
The old man gave no answer.
In a minute.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
It might have done me good.
There is nothing more to be said.
He is among us.
You better stay here all night.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Yes and no.
Are you strong?
And sit in the dark?
Oh, no.
Which box do you mean?
Be quick, for the time is short.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Do you see that island?
Here is our plan.
But what then must be done?
It is no use, said a voice.
Nothing new under the sun.
Is my father in town?
It is certain.
Be back in a minute.
He saw nothing.
That is a fact.
Is it possible?
Come quick.
You are free to do so.
Never mind that.
What have they done?
In her name, then, let it be done.
Why, of course.
Why did you bring him here?
You know you must say yes.
Yes, we know that.
She got her hand free.
We are free to act and think.
It was cold and dark.
His will be done.
At his side was a large green box.
Yes, she was back.
Of course she will.
Of course it might.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
But let us see your plan.
Will you rest here a little?
Is that possible?
Stay where you are.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
How can a little dog laugh?
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Wait for me.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
It is time for bed.
Is that a fact?
Wonder if he has a name.
Hold on a minute.
It was a very dark night.
She was still game.
They know nothing about it.
Yes, you are right.
Oh, just listen.
Sit down, he said.
It was a kind of language between us.
His first cry was for his father.
See what you have done.
Look at that dark water.
Oh, do the best you can.
The water ran dry.
Who gave it to you?
Keep clear of him.
The night was very dark.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Then it is certain?
And yet you said he had money.
It was a warm night.
Dont laugh.
Did she fall?
Yes, it is true.
That would be a fine thing.
The city was soon behind me.
Bring this with you.
It must be done.
He never said nothing.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Fine, very fine.
She began to cry.
What can be done?
And then the game began all over again.
He will sleep an hour.
It was brought to me.
Of course they will.
Yes, she could sing that.
Well, there he stood.
It was so very long ago.
Of course he was right.
They all fall to the ground.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
No, nothing of the kind.
Lead me to him.
Oh, take those off.
Where can you wait for me?
All right then, sit down.
Nothing had come of it.
Decide if you are going back home.
You knew it, and said nothing?
It is nothing.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
This made him wonder more and more.
Oh, all right.
Yes, very well.
What is power?
It is possible.
There was more to be done.
Money is power.
Clear the table.
You will fall.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Oh, how can you sleep?
It was so long ago.
Wonder what he does.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Yes, she said.
He is in the box.
Of course it is.
And here is the note.
And what a voice she has.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Well then, be quick.
What have they done with my work?
The snow is deep.
Wait and see.
Good to rest once in a way.
Yes, said the old man.
Oh, but you were there?
All of this was possible.
Take good note of it.
What is done is done.
Yes, that is true.
There, by the wheel.
It is done.
How long ago?
Never mind how he came here.
Do you talk in your sleep?
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Did he fall?
He knew nothing.
Well, what about my plan?
We must be quick.
Leave the rest to me.
Yes, go and find out.
Oh, to be sure.
Wait a second.
But never mind that.
My mind is made up.
The island was a mile long.
He has a good voice still.
That is possible.
Behind every book is a man.
Laugh, if you will.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
He had made up his mind.
Just go to sleep.
Oh, do you know?
Let her wait.
He must be in the same boat as us.
But that is nothing to us.
And he told you nothing?
Yes, there it is.
But how long ago?
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Come, and we can rest together.
Oh let me in.
A fine thing too.
Now we must wait.
He gave me this paper.
Nothing she can eat?
Again came the voice.
Bring them here.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
But wait a minute.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Is it certain?
Oh, do as you like.
You must stay with me.
Let me see your plan.
Clear the way.
Oh, dont ask me.
How long would you keep me in town?
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Oh, come now.
How was that possible?
This is a test.
Bring it here.
It was hot.
All that for nothing?
He must wait.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
My mind was soon made up.
If only they would be quick.
Then all was dark again.
Oh, this is too much.
It was done.
is it come yet?
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Let him go free?
Your voice is that of a young man.
What a game.
Oh, he is so kind.
Yes, he did.
Her voice was low.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Oh, of course.
Did she stay long?
Well, miss?
How was it done?
And what have you done to me?
Nothing could be more simple.
Oh, nothing.
Yes, but what did she say?
Yes, sit down.
Can it be possible?
She heard and saw nothing.
Oh, very well, he said.
Yes, my love?
Is he in bed?
It is very clear.
Yes, to be sure.
Well, of course.
You brought no one with you?
You know nothing about it.
You love a certain person.
The whole day had been hot.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Oh, go on.
They call him a fine boy.
Oh, you are there.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Never mind me.
and so he decide he go back home.
Oh, take me with you.
Yes, and no.
What more is to be done?
Oh, if men only knew.
They need a rest.
Wait for me here, all of you.
In that town there is a street.
There is no possible way.
What have you done?
But they could see nothing.
And yet you are the better off?
The little boy lay in his bed.
What age is he?
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
But it must be done soon.
Get to bed.
Let us sit down.
It must be done at once.
I hear his voice in the house.
You are in my power.
He ran up to them.
What has brought you here?
Yes, once.
He stood up.
Half the town was there.
Go and rest.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Free to do what?
What brought you here?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
It is all done.
It has to be done.
Oh, man.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Behind my bed.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Oh, that.
Answer me that, miss.
He was here a minute ago.
Go in there and drive them out.
You can sleep here.
Help me sit up.
You must stay.
