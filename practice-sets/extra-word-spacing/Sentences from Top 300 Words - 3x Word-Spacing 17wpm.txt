Sure of what?
Who found them out?
We are together.
They came over last night.
Are we too late?
But it is all all too late now.
But then you would be close to the sea?
And now, good night.
what river is it?
Music is a good thing.
Who could have thought it?
Can you hear me?
Where have you been this long while?
Which story was it?
Dont say that to me.
Is he a real father?
Have you been at sea?
Few had found it.
We got one and they got one.
Why dont you want to go?
He may come close.
Ask one of those men.
See him grow up.
Dont you see that?
And your children?
A second man got up and went out.
We dont see it like that.
The sun had set long since.
Just cut it out, will you?
The other night she left.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
She saw it.
Then, good night.
We must go at once.
But she saw no one?
It must be in her own house.
Say good night.
Stop and think.
Where has she run off to?
By and by he got it.
He had only one night more to live.
They dont know their own country.
There was no answer.
But watch over him.
So he began to help.
What was left of him?
But are you sure of that?
You got me?
It is well thought of.
What a start that was.
Who was the letter from?
So, once more, good night.
Watch him, he said.
Who can answer for that?
Look at his face.
You have a car?
Tell her to begin.
But it was very late.
No, stop.
Well, read the letter again.
But you got to play music for them.
Why, is it late?
Is my father here?
Dont you want any?
Right here it began.
You must eat now.
He had two left feet.
Just a few.
It is open?
She came over last night.
They never did it again.
And what did you learn from him?
This is my country.
Come, let us be men.
Let me know at once when you will start.
This is what began it all.
The children will live just the same.
How could you let him go so far?
What would you have me do with my life?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
What was the name of the man who took it?
Here is the letter.
You might want it.
Always the same, year after year.
Let me go back.
Off with his head.
And what did you do with that letter?
Let us cross over.
Why should this be so?
Come at once.
Who said four?
Just cut it out.
Well, run back to her.
You took it.
Why, dont you hear it?
Stop, let me show you the way.
What did you hear?
But take care.
Do you want to cross?
Let me see him at once.
A call for help, you thought?
That was the first night.
What did he say in the letter?
She came in just now by the back door.
Come over in the sun.
He is at sea.
How did it begin?
He came at once.
Do you have the letter?
Who let you in?
And then they began to fish.
How many children?
Let me hear what it is.
Are you my friend?
She is still here?
It will be too late.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Which end is his head?
Cut him down.
Point it at his horse.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
And she left the room.
What should he say?
He then said, It is time to start.
Are you sure of it?
But what did you hear?
Does he never go out?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Is it in the city?
Now or never.
It is so very kind of you both.
Off with her head.
She saw no one?
How could you begin?
Write an answer.
Good for the country.
Go to your father.
Let me be and let me live.
Who took him out of it?
Let me see her.
To the left.
Here he is at last.
Do we stop here?
Is there any answer?
What country does he come from?
We got to let that go.
Why, it was one of his own men.
No, never.
This is real.
Dont tell me.
What a night it has been.
Let me out.
So take care of me.
Let us go in.
First turn to the left.
Do you have a car?
But it is the same with any life.
No, dont.
Cut your hand open?
One never has too much.
Any book will tell you that.
Then let me have a word with you.
Never see him again.
Both of us.
Have you got it?
Have you got that?
Give me the letter.
It was white.
He has been been found.
She got up.
Did you see his eye?
It was his own room.
No, why should he?
My father is right.
But they may still come here.
No, said the Tree.
Always the same with you people.
They never come back.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
This took him some time.
Keep to the right.
It might help.
There, do you hear?
You found him?
Will you never learn?
For once you are right.
We may be too late.
You must never tell.
But hard to tell.
It was then time to start.
What was it that you thought?
Have you found it?
At last we have a man.
We might learn a thing or two.
Let him answer us.
She is my friend.
We should ask him.
Dont move, he said.
Let me see him.
So they got out and went in.
Tell me more.
But why dont you want to take it?
He is my father.
We found it.
What is life to you?
That is the idea.
But then it will be too late.
We should look at this.
Are we late?
What do you hear?
He saw his men draw back.
Where is the river?
He is my friend.
She never came back.
Keep to the left.
And there are four of you?
We are very far from that.
Why should they?
These were the first people we saw.
Do you know where he is?
Where is this city?
Who should it be?
Do you often come back?
No, said her father.
How many are left?
Can you stand?
Let me see it.
Let me look.
There were few near me.
They are hard at it.
Let me hear your story.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Do you want some more to eat?
It was the last day of the year.
Was you in my room?
He had no idea how long he had been there.
They are always the same.
It is music.
It is a long story.
We got under way at last.
Let him follow me.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Let him grow up with you.
Let them have it.
He is always at it.
And then we may begin.
And who is this friend?
Think of my father.
Now you must eat.
Let me get on with my work.
There to the left.
How would they stop it?
He has children of his own.
Why dont you play?
And this food?
You are sure of it?
You are sure of that?
How much have you got?
And he left the room.
Open the door.
Dont you like it?
And why should they?
Life is all right.
Keep watch all night.
Let me have a word with you.
Have you never been there?
Take care.
But let us walk.
She might be at his house.
it took all that time to come over the water.
In the country?
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
It is always so.
It would seem so.
Good night again.
He might still be up.
Come eat with me.
We were together.
Let her go.
Do you hear that?
Here we see the boy at school.
There are only four of us.
Still, you never know.
We never thought of that.
That night we were just in time.
Let me in.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
It was very hard.
Good night, friend.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Do you hear me?
Our own people must come first.
But now it is too late.
Call the next one.
What do you think of the music?
Tell us a story.
Let us go back.
At four, she said.
And now let us go home.
Come let us see them.
Come here, my friend.
There is only food for one.
Watch over him.
What did he answer?
Do you know what he did last night?
What is your real name?
Stop, said he.
Is it far?
You must study.
So it always was.
You should take me there one day.
Why do you stop here?
Let me say one thing.
Let me go to the door.
But you must never tell.
Only, dont look back.
One of us will be here all night.
There was no letter for me.
It was the first thing he thought of.
You are right, father.
Why is he cross with me?
Do you know how he made his mark?
What do you think when you hear music?
Who did you learn that from?
But it would be in the paper.
Let me get to work.
He could run no more.
Now let me have it.
They may tell us to open it.
Here is the book.
One was on a white horse.
Is that far?
Here is the paper.
No, that can never be.
Where could you keep it?
She must have a hard time with him.
They dont care.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Let us start, then.
You saw him?
You must walk.
When did you begin?
Dont you think so?
It is from your father.
Well, what next?
He said at last.
At this time of my life, no.
We must begin again.
It was like new life to him.
Are you sure?
They always know.
Take care of him.
You will answer for it.
