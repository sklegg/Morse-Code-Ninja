We have him.
Then there is more to do.
Will you come and see her?
Then who are you?
But how about you?
Go on, he said.
Now is your time.
What can we do, then?
At what number?
are you there?
We have no water.
Look over it.
but what if it is?
How is she?
Which is it?
Now there is no more to be said.
Look at him.
Look at it.
What other way is there to look at it?
How was that?
And is that all?
You have them?
What do you make of it?
But will he see it?
But who was she?
And what did you see?
There you are, he said.
You know more than we do.
Would you like some?
Then what are you up to now?
And how did you find out?
But WHAT DID you see?
What did they do?
What are we to do?
Had to look the other way.
Then make it up.
And all for what?
And what is that?
There they are.
And what do you make of it?
What have you come for?
What could it be?
What was it?
Is that her?
Is she like him?
What are you up to?
Come this way.
But he had no time.
Do you see him?
But he had to have it.
what has she to do with it?
That is a long time.
Then how many are there?
What is he like?
Do as you like.
What is it like?
The time will come.
who, then, are you?
Do you see it?
May we come in?
No was there one?
Who will go first?
Do as you will.
So it was.
How is he?
One or two?
So that was the way.
Is he there?
How would you like to have it?
And could she see him?
What did you do then?
What time is it?
How do you do?
but there was more to it than this.
When is it?
That will do, he said.
So be it.
Did you know them?
What do they call you?
Do you like him?
What DO you know of him?
And who is this?
You can have some.
Do you know?
But what will you do?
But when will that be?
There is but one thing to do.
who can it be?
What is that?
At what time?
Can it be?
How did she do it?
Do you know him?
Would you do what he did?
Is it like him?
Who and what are you?
But so it is.
That was all she said.
And do you like him?
Is that all?
And when will you call?
There were two of them.
Who was he?
Do you know what it is?
How did he do it?
It was from you.
And what was it for?
That was it.
How can it be?
Did you see her?
What is it all about?
Now you know.
And what did you do then?
Look at them.
What will you do, then?
Will that do?
So there it was.
How did you come by it?
What was he like?
Look at it this way.
Is it over?
What would she have said?
And do you like her?
There he is, you see.
How is he now?
Now what are we to do with you?
That will do, said he.
But it has been so long.
What do you see?
When was it?
Is it time?
but we can go and see.
How can you know?
Are you there?
Can one see from there?
But what have they been up to?
Did you know her?
What is all this?
You know how it is with her.
There he is, do you see him?
Do you know what you look like?
What did he do to you?
When was that?
Do they know him?
You have it.
Can you do that?
They said no more.
You can go.
What do you make of that?
Who are you?
He said no.
You can do it.
You may go.
The time had come.
But it was of no use.
How are you?
And who was that?
Who was that?
But what are you up to?
There you are.
But what is it?
There he is, she said.
What is it for?
Who is she?
Then, how do you know?
Tqhen you may go.
How long has he been there?
Do you know her?
So it is.
What is there to see?
And what do you call her?
Did you know him?
That is what she did.
And who are you?
No one will come, she said.
What was it about?
Call him in.
How did you know about it?
What can this be?
what is it?
Or so they said.
And has it come to this?
Has it come to this?
But how is that?
and so on, and so on.
What is it about?
Is that it?
She has it.
Then what is it?
Out of the way.
Did you see it?
And who is this?
How long has he been there?
That was all she said.
Would you do what he did?
How did she do it?
But it was of no use.
Who was that?
There were two of them.
who, then, are you?
How is he?
Then how many are there?
How can it be?
What is that?
What was he like?
Can you do that?
You can do it.
Look at it.
What is it for?
Then, how do you know?
So there it was.
Then who are you?
Will that do?
Come this way.
Has it come to this?
Then there is more to do.
And what was it for?
Then what is it?
Do they know him?
And when will you call?
When was it?
There is but one thing to do.
But what have they been up to?
How do you do?

But WHAT DID you see?
You have it.
Do you like him?
When is it?
But he had no time.
Do as you like.
Is he there?
Then what are you up to now?
Go on, he said.
But what are you up to?
And who are you?
And what is that?
And is that all?
That was it.
What is it all about?
Did you know them?
It was from you.
What is it about?

Now you know.
Do as you will.
What other way is there to look at it?
The time had come.
What do you see?
What will you do, then?
No one will come, she said.
There you are.
Then make it up.
That is what she did.
How was that?
Who and what are you?
No was there one?
What time is it?
She has it.
Do you know?
There you are, he said.
But it has been so long.
Out of the way.
