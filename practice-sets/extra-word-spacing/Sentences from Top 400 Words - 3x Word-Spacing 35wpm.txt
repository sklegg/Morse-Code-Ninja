We are ready.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
If you only knew.
We knew them both.
Well, young man?
Why do you serve?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
And dont talk to me.
It was true.
You can pass through the door.
He got it this morning.
Light my fire.
In short, take me.
You may go, said the King.
Half as many is too much.
Who was it told me his name?
He is better than any of you.
So do you, my love.
She knew at once.
Answer me this one question.
They all heard me.
Can it be true?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
It is a rock.
Do you want any money?
But what did we ever get for it?
Remember that time?
It was all she could do to hold in.
This is my body.
Better late than never.
You were told.
Let us pass.
And you are still so young.
A house is on fire?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
But enough of this.
Are they made to order?
That would be the best way.
That is true.
Then get ready at once.
And will you direct us?
Your true father?
What kind of a bird?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
It was cold.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
They had several children.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
It is a fire.
Is your family well?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Leave me out of the question.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
How far from the body?
There are four hundred?
Are you here on leave?
Did he though?
She told me all about it.
Ten will be early enough.
You are a good girl.
Is your man white or black?
She is very plain.
And why do you serve?
Before you leave, tell us.
You will soon know.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Then you will know me better.
What is love?
Five young children.
But let that pass.
What a question.
you should know her better than me.
Read them, said the King.
In an hour?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
She is much better.
Keep in step.
What is there to talk about?
And then he told all he knew.
But she is very young.
Leave off that.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
In an hour it will be at the door.
But how simple it is.
That must be true.
No, my love.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
This was true.
But listen to this, he said.
The family was at home.
How did this happen?
who told you you could?
Ten, did you say?
Let me also ask you a question.
Can she sing?
Pass this way, then.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Is it true?
She was so young, too.
you must step out.
What have you heard?
He said, get him out of the road.
You have an hour.
The dog is always with him.
Listen to him.
The night was cold and still.
They had much to talk about.
Let this man pass.
Fire and water, earth and air.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Let me hear from you soon.
No less, no more.
Much of it was true.
And serve them right.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Had they been heard?
Now listen to me.
That is enough.
Never heard of it before.
You love him?
Do you love her much?
It is cold.
They had heard all that before.
There was no wind.
Is the wind north or south?
To know her is to love her.
That was the question.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
Where did they get the money from?
She is fast?
You are on a ship?
Against what side?
It is true.
How short his time.
What will happen now?
Have you heard?
She is the first person in this house.
You are right, my love.
Can you sing?
We must make the best of it.
Are you in love with her?
Look to the west.
We serve them.
You had better go.
Let us talk a little about my father.
He never told us what it was she said.
An hour and a half.
Why did it happen?
Who told you so?
We had a list.
Have you told her?
As soon as you left, it began.
She knew what was good for children.
It has been there ever since.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
The world is big enough.
Let me remember what he said.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Why do they want to make her sing?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
The King Went to him.
How does this happen?
He had enough of it.
We had better go in.
You are in love with me?
Let us leave them, she said.
you know better than that.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Is that true?
You know me well enough.
What does he feel?
Let me see him, said the young man.
We will talk about that.
Half a mile?
Well, are you ready?
It is a young girl.
You will always love him?
A young man?
He is very simple.
Where are you off to so early?
Had you heard?
Try it on the dog first.
No, he is a man about my size.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
And how did he make his money?
Feel better then.
So we came down this road.
Are we ready?
Was he young or old?
Better cross here.
He put his hand over part of the map.
Take notice.
Are you better?
Did they ever go back?
Take a hold of it.
Long live the king.
Pull together.
Will you answer that question?
And so they began to talk.
He will leave me.
Take good care of the little girl.
When do you leave?
So the question was, what to do?
Why do we love?
Listen to me.
No more money?
And you will always love him?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
She had very little notice from him.
Better write it here.
And you can sing?
It would be better if you went to the war.
What size do you want?
Every word you said was heard.
She told me to ask you.
And so they knew that it was true.
Do you remember him?
He said, the work is now complete.
Let us talk about you.
Do you remember?
We got her half way.
Leave any for him?
You saw the person?
Has she any family?
That is very simple.
But listen to me.
It was a round table.
We were up early.
Did you get any money?
Do you own a dog?
That was the rule, she said.
The rock was very small.
This will pass in no time.
But why must you leave me so soon?
An example would be better.
what could be better?
The night was cold.
On fire, on fire.
This money was for her.
They knew it.
Are you ready to play?
Have you heard from him often?
Never heard of him.
Let that pass.
About the usual time.
Hold it up to the light.
We call it black.
A better man than you.
It was true to life.
Does he love you?
Do you remember me?
How soon will he be here?
Are you all ready?
And that is the whole point.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
He has money.
Do you know that old lay?
What a state he was in.
Does she go fast?
Are you ready?
She must be told.
What have you against me now?
Made me feel so young.
But he never heard me.
Never heard of it.
You must travel.
That may be true.
One other question, said he.
How do you feel?
Long and the short of it.
Young man, you will go far.
Pull it more to your side.
Do you love me?
How many children did he leave?
He knew them.
How do you feel now?
It would have been more simple.
What can happen?
Are you still cold?
It will interest you, said he.
Where he was, no one knew.
They left in the morning.
That is enough for me.
Did you tell him your whole story?
You remember the place, my father?
Ask them to sing one more song.
You may leave the room.
She was a good girl.
I have no children to love me.
Little girl, where have you been?
But one day you must feel it.
Hold her hand.
Now, listen.
You are cold.
You are better than that.
This is simple.
You are right, young man.
He had my love.
Which king?
They are still young.
Who told you that?
They can have all our half of the house.
Listen to them, he said.
What do you mean by that question?
Your watch is slow.
When did this happen?
Have you a family?
It can never happen.
What will happen to us?
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
And what does she want the money for?
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Listen to this, will you?
It is the rule.
She was only a little girl.
We took our leave early, and left together.
You must leave that to me.
How could that happen?
They told me to.
Then what would happen?
How does it feel?
If you know it, that is enough.
Why talk to me?
Put down three and carry five.
He never heard.
From then on it was war between them.
We dont know enough.
