And when will you call?
Would you do what he did?
There you are, he said.
Do you know him?
At what time?
Now is your time.
And what do you make of it?
Is it time?
Did you know her?
and so on, and so on.
Then who are you?
Come this way.
So that was the way.
How long has he been there?
What is it for?
But when will that be?
What are we to do?
You know how it is with her.
What are you up to?
And do you like him?
Is it over?
Are you there?
who, then, are you?
what has she to do with it?
But it has been so long.
And how did you find out?
Has it come to this?
Is he there?
There is but one thing to do.
There you are.
What was it?
That was it.
Then, how do you know?
What is all this?
Out of the way.
What other way is there to look at it?
How is he?
But what is it?
But so it is.
What do you see?
Look at them.
How was that?
He said no.
Is that it?
You may go.
So there it was.
but what if it is?
Look at it.
Who will go first?
That was all she said.
How is he now?
And what is that?
Who was he?
That is a long time.
But it was of no use.
What do they call you?
You know more than we do.
And what did you do then?
There he is, do you see him?
Did you know him?
The time had come.
But what are you up to?
At what number?
What is it all about?
You have it.
What DO you know of him?
but there was more to it than this.
Look over it.
How did you come by it?
Which is it?
Did you see it?
But will he see it?
They said no more.
what is it?
But he had no time.
Who is she?
but we can go and see.
And is that all?
How can you know?
What is it like?
How do you do?
And who is this?
Can one see from there?
We have him.
But how is that?
But he had to have it.
Did you see her?
What do you make of it?
That will do, said he.
Do you know?
What was it about?
What did you do then?
But what have they been up to?
And all for what?
What is there to see?
Now what are we to do with you?
But who was she?
And what was it for?
Go on, he said.
Do as you will.
So it is.
Then what is it?
What did they do?
How did she do it?
And do you like her?
You can do it.
Who and what are you?
Look at him.
Then what are you up to now?
It was from you.
Now you know.
Who are you?
But WHAT DID you see?
What can we do, then?
Is that all?
are you there?
May we come in?
who can it be?
There were two of them.
But what will you do?
How did he do it?
What can this be?
But how about you?
One or two?
Then there is more to do.
Who was that?
You can go.
When was that?
That is what she did.
Had to look the other way.
Do you like him?
Can you do that?
Do they know him?
What could it be?
Or so they said.
There they are.
And what did you see?
What did he do to you?
Now there is no more to be said.
Look at it this way.
Is she like him?
How are you?
And could she see him?
Do as you like.
You can have some.
How can it be?
The time will come.
What is it about?
We have no water.
What is that?
And who was that?
So it was.
Will that do?
How is she?
There he is, you see.
Then make it up.
Do you know her?
She has it.
Would you like some?
Do you see it?
What do you make of that?
And what do you call her?
Call him in.
When is it?
How would you like to have it?
There he is, she said.
What will you do, then?
Tqhen you may go.
Do you know what it is?
And who are you?
No was there one?
You have them?
Did you know them?
When was it?
What is he like?
That will do, he said.
And has it come to this?
What would she have said?
What was he like?
Is it like him?
Can it be?
What time is it?
Will you come and see her?
How did you know about it?
So be it.
No one will come, she said.
Do you see him?
Then how many are there?
Is that her?
What have you come for?
Do you know what you look like?
What was it?
Would you do what he did?
who, then, are you?
And when will you call?
There is but one thing to do.
What other way is there to look at it?
What would she have said?
But how about you?
What is all this?
Will that do?
Can it be?
Go on, he said.
How did he do it?
But what will you do?
But what have they been up to?
And how did you find out?
Look at them.
Do as you like.
How is he?
But when will that be?
But what is it?
Then there is more to do.
Then make it up.
How long has he been there?
And do you like him?
She has it.
When was it?
Did you know him?
but there was more to it than this.
Now is your time.
When is it?
One or two?
Call him in.
There they are.
What is he like?
You can have some.
You can do it.
Can you do that?
How was that?
At what number?
Then, how do you know?
How can it be?
What is it about?
Or so they said.
How did she do it?
How do you do?
And could she see him?
But what are you up to?
At what time?
What have you come for?
are you there?
There you are, he said.
But it has been so long.
Now what are we to do with you?
What are we to do?
Do as you will.
They said no more.
And all for what?
And what did you see?
Do you see it?
But so it is.
What was it about?
No one will come, she said.
Do you know?
And what did you do then?
May we come in?
Is it time?
He said no.
Out of the way.
But will he see it?
Do you like him?
Then what are you up to now?
Has it come to this?
So it was.
What did they do?
Do you know what you look like?
Tqhen you may go.
Is she like him?
What is it for?
What do they call you?
Who was that?
and so on, and so on.
And who is this?
You know more than we do.
No was there one?
Did you know them?
You have it.
Who are you?
That is what she did.
There were two of them.
what has she to do with it?
Is it like him?
And what was it for?
Will you come and see her?
And do you like her?
who can it be?
But WHAT DID you see?
Then how many are there?
What did you do then?
Can one see from there?
What did he do to you?
And what is that?
How would you like to have it?
So there it was.
There he is, you see.
What is that?
And who was that?
Is it over?
Do you see him?
Now there is no more to be said.
What do you see?
Is he there?
But how is that?
But it was of no use.
Do they know him?
You know how it is with her.
Which is it?
Who will go first?
Did you know her?
There you are.
Come this way.
You can go.
Did you see it?
Do you know him?
But he had no time.
How is he now?
So that was the way.
What is it all about?
Had to look the other way.
How can you know?
We have no water.
That will do, said he.
And what do you call her?
So it is.
But who was she?
Is that all?
And is that all?
What will you do, then?
What are you up to?
That was it.
What DO you know of him?
But he had to have it.
Are you there?
Look at it.
How is she?
Who and what are you?
Is that it?
what is it?
When was that?
That is a long time.
The time will come.
What can we do, then?
but we can go and see.
Do you know her?
What time is it?
That was all she said.
Then what is it?
but what if it is?
Is that her?
We have him.
You may go.
And who are you?
Who was he?
That will do, he said.
Look over it.
It was from you.
What do you make of that?
What is it like?
Do you know what it is?
Look at it this way.
And what do you make of it?
There he is, do you see him?
You have them?
Who is she?
What do you make of it?
How did you come by it?
What is there to see?
The time had come.
How did you know about it?
So be it.
What can this be?
And has it come to this?
There he is, she said.
Would you like some?
Did you see her?
Now you know.
What could it be?
Then who are you?
What was he like?
Look at him.
How are you?
