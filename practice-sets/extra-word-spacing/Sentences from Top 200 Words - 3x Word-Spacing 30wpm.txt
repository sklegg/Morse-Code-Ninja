Very well, he said.
Where did you place it?
But what does it mean?
Ask her, he said.
Show me the way.
And in she went.
there are only two.
Too much of this.
They want more.
Will you try?
Where did he come from?
That is the end of her.
Turn this way.
Come and help me.
In what part of the house?
Just look through it.
You think so, too?
He has more to give.
where did she come from?
But you must.
This for me?
But what did you want?
Then will come our time.
Give me your hand.
You can say what it is.
Are you here for good?
After three, he said.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Is it all right?
How on earth do you know?
Some day you may ask me about it.
Call me what you will, he said.
And what was his name?
For how much?
How can you tell?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Now it was time to act.
But where are we to go?
Were you here before me?
Is it you or me?
Good day, one and all.
This is my point.
And how in the world did you find them?
Are you at it again?
Where are you from?
Well, what do you think?
And what are they made of?
How did you get me out?
How did you get here?
do you come from the end of the world?
No, tell me.
What do you think of her?
Been back long?
He is at my house.
At your house?
Say no more.
Where do they get that?
Think of him.
But this is the point.
It is the same thing.
What will each of you give?
You can help me here.
Get out and play.
And a very good thing, too.
Play with them.
He went on his way.
What does she want?
What would you have me do?
They had all been very good to us.
Do you think so now?
Now come here.
Would you now like to look round my place?
There she is again.
Where could he be?
How did that help you?
Will you come with me?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
And how did you find out?
He was so kind.
One, two, three.
Where is he?
Now where did they come from?
Time to get out.
There is the little boy.
How do you take it?
Now, what do you want with me?
He said too much.
When will it take place?
She was right.
Get to work.
Where have they been?
Is he big?
And what about your mother?
And what do you think?
We are here.
Now, you know me.
And where is this man?
He will ask for it.
Take some, she said.
Here is my hand.
What more could a man ask for?
Why are you like this?
But he is right.
This is the man.
Where in the world did you come from?
In what year?
But what about me?
Where are they off to now?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Give it me.
Take this and this.
And what did she say?
It would be very kind of you.
How long have you been here?
Very well, show him to me.
What on earth does this mean?
But who was your mother?
Now we see the light.
Put it on.
But where is he?
Well, tell me.
Go and try.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Do you want me to do it?
Move on, then.
Large or small?
Tell us your name.
What did you say that for?
Think no more about that.
Here it is, he said.
You see it every day.
Who will tell her?
What do you play?
You are all very kind to me.
Come with me, then.
What was it you said to me?
That was a good time.
What do they want?
Well, how did it go?
Too much for me now.
What do you mean by that?
What a good thing it would be.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
That was a house to look at.
Is it large?
What do you want me to do?
See, they are here.
This is the first act.
Well then, what do you want?
Come with me to the little house.
Well, all right.
Is she well?
Follow me, said the man.
We will say no more about it, then.
We are who we say we are.
She went on.
Why are you here?
What is his name?
Why is that?
How much are they?
What do they say was the cause?
What does one live for?
What do you think of that?
She was the cause of it all.
Where are you?
Good day to you.
He was here.
What do you want to ask these people?
She had to tell him.
Tell us all about it.
You think so?
And what is her name?
And it did me good.
What on earth do you mean?
Here is the way we put in the time.
Where are we?
You must come now.
What is your name?
You are most kind.
And what will they do with us?
That is right, said the old man.
It was high time.
Too much in the way.
It is great.
Show me the way he went.
What could set you off in the first place?
Three, he said.
He was there too.
See, here it is.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Come with me.
It will take a little time.
Why are they here?
Say no more about it.
When will he come back?
There was work to do.
There is no one here to see.
What do you mean?
Much good that would be.
Read that, she said.
What was his name?
What is that in your hand?
Why do you want water?
Where are you off to?
What does it all mean?
What do you want?
When will her mother come?
And why is that?
Give it to me, then.
Why is he here?
The world is before you.
Who are these men?
Is that all you want?
Is this the man?
And off we go.
To what end?
Look at me.
Well, and is that all?
Are they like each other?
For some man.
We must come back.
That would be very good.
How can you say that?
What have you been after?
Well, what do you think about it?
What did he tell you?
Do you think she was?
Give me more than that
Then what kind is it?
Say what you want.
The first act was over.
What you have just said is good, very good.
Is it any good?
Do you know me?
Here she is.
How does she use you?
And who is the man?
Then why are you here?
You will get on in the world.
Well, go on.
There, that does me good.
Do you think so?
I would like to see her again in that.
Now, go home.
You are a good boy.
What does she think about me?
No, mother.
He will live.
Well, did he?
Tell me about it.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Who is that man?
Give me a light.
What does he mean?
How can you think of such a thing?
What is in your hand?
Why, what do you mean?
Why, what is it, then?
Hand it in.
That is right.
Think it over.
What will you say?
Where are we to turn for help?
And where is she, then?
And where is he now?
Good, he said.
He went to him.
Why do you want to know?
Can you take me?
You must take me with you.
That was very good.
What did he say?
And where was the place?
Why did he come?
But why do you ask?
It must be where you put it.
Is it as good now?
Then they will follow you?
How can you find out?
And they went home.
this one, too?
How much do you want?
You know, you see right through people.
And that was the end of it.
Are you back again?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
She came up to them.
Can you help me find my way?
It is very kind of you.
Now tell me.
Have you been here long?
She has been with him many long years.
Which house is it?
Tell me his name.
You are right.
Where is he now?
And have you been here long?
All right, then.
Here it is.
Where does he live?
Just look at her.
There is more to tell.
But it is just so with the world.
Is that right?
What did you say your name was?
Ask him to show up?
Did you tell him?
How does he use it?
How could she say such a thing.
Well, and what do you think?
What could she mean by it?
But why do you ask me?
Is there some for me?
Where have you been?
And what did he say?
Well, how are you?
All in good time.
If you want to know, go and find out.
Where do you live?
He said that that would help.
Well then, tell him so.
How old are you?
They are here.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Can you point it out to me?
He was at work again.
You must tell me.
Think what you will.
And how old were you at that time?
Will you take me to her?
Well, read it.
There will just be time.
Very well then.
What does all this mean?
Where to, now?
take them all.
Tell me all about it.
That is all one can say about her.
She has a house?
Is he a good man?
And where is it?
Read that, he said.
You were near him.
Just like me.
Try it on.
But where is it?
What do you think of this?
And do you know why?
There was no one near.
It is very high.
Such as what?
Well, here he is.
It is all the same.
Look at it other way round.
Give him air.
How old was she?
That is just my point.
What do you think of him?
Where is she?
But he does so need a mother.
There is no place like home.
Give me my work.
Show it to me.
Do it for me.
Only two there now.
Get out of the way.
Is there no one who can help me?
Tell me who made the world.
