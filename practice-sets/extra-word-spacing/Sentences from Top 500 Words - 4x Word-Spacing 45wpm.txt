This made him wonder more and more.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Stay where you are.
Go and rest.
Yes, there it is.
In a minute.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Are you strong?
It was cold and dark.
Why did you bring him here?
It was full of people.
How was it done?
It was a dark night.
You know nothing about it.
All that for nothing?
He is among us.
Play the game out.
Here is our plan.
Money is power.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Go in there and drive them out.
Oh, but you were there?
Sit down and let us talk it over.
That is a fact.
It is all done.
Well, what does that lead up to?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
I hear his voice in the house.
This is a test.
They need a rest.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Fine, very fine.
Just let us go free.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
He knew nothing.
It was very dark.
Oh, just listen.
Did she fall?
It was a kind of language between us.
He stood up.
Come, let me show you my plan.
There is a lot of people.
And then the game began all over again.
Oh, all right.
It is no use, said a voice.
Behind every book is a man.
It must be done.
Take good note of it.
Did he fall?
In that town there is a street.
Like these in shape and size?
Yes, it did.
Try to sleep.
No, nothing at all.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Nothing she can eat?
Be back in a minute.
You knew it, and said nothing?
You will fall.
But wait a minute.
Get to bed.
Yes, but what did she say?
And what have you done to me?
It is a real bed.
The old man gave no answer.
What has brought you here?
Where can you wait for me?
A fine thing too.
Her voice was low.
Oh let me in.
Be quick, for the time is short.
But she is nothing to me now.
He was here a minute ago.
Yes, sit down.
We brought them in.
Yes, he said.
Are they on foot?
He had made up his mind.
You must have a rest.
All was dark.
He must be in the same boat as us.
Oh, do the best you can.
Go back to bed.
Bring it here.
Well yes, you are right.
What can be done?
Of course it might.
It was brought to me.
Never mind how he came here.
He saw nothing.
You know you must say yes.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
There is no one in that room behind you.
She got her hand free.
Yes, she said.
All right then, sit down.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Clear the way.
Better sit still.
The island was a mile long.
Oh, tell me.
You can sleep here.
That was well done.
She began to cry.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
The water ran dry.
It stood behind the door.
It was hot.
Yes, of course.
We must be quick.
There is nothing more to be said.
Fly, my friend.
He is in the box.
My mind is made up.
He gave me this paper.
It is possible.
That would be a fine thing.
Oh, come now.
It must be done at once.
Just go to sleep.
It is his voice.
Well, of course.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Did she stay long?
You are in my power.
Then lead the way.
How long ago?
If only they would be quick.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Oh, you are there.
But what then must be done?
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
His first cry was for his father.
No, nothing of the kind.
You better stay here all night.
Oh, do you know?
What a game.
Yes, go and find out.
Oh, this is too much.
Yes, it is true.
Quick, friend, quick.
What have they done with my work?
He never said nothing.
Yes, very well.
Is it certain?
We are more strong together.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
What is done is done.
It is certain.
Money is no object?
Yes, he did.
Wait a minute.
Oh, that.
Sit down, he said.
Wonder what he does.
Well, sit down.
Yes, once.
You are free to do so.
She could think of nothing more to say.
He brought it with him for us to see.
But never mind that.
They all fall to the ground.
It has to be done.
It was done.
The night was dark.
Did it all rest on me?
See what you have done.
And you can do nothing until then?
Very well, wait a minute.
Perhaps he did.
Oh, nothing.
How long would you keep me in town?
You must stay with me.
This voice was that of my father.
It was a warm night.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Laugh, if you will.
Nothing at all.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Then he must be a wonder.
Yes, he said, all of it.
Nothing new under the sun.
Oh, take me with you.
There, by the wheel.
Wonder if he has a name.
Nothing had come of it.
Why, of course.
The city was soon behind me.
Wait for me.
Do you see that island?
At his side was a large green box.
Is that a fact?
What did the letter contain?
You love a certain person.
In her name, then, let it be done.
How can a little dog laugh?
Nothing could be more simple.
Oh, to be sure.
Let us sit down.
Oh, dont ask me.
Keep clear of him.
Sit down, said the old man.
Do you talk in your sleep?
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Well, what about my plan?
Again came the voice.
Is he in bed?
Well, sit down by me.
Oh, he is so kind.
But it must be done soon.
Come, and we can rest together.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Nothing is more simple.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Yes, but only for you and me.
It was so long ago.
His will be done.
And yet you said he had money.
Of course he was right.
It was a cold, dark night.
Yes, my love?
Wait a second.
Do you have my note?
Yes, she could sing that.
Oh, take those off.
Is my father in town?
Never mind me.
Help me sit up.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Who brought you up?
Well, there he stood.
Oh, how can you sleep?
We are free to act and think.
Oh, go on.
Look at that dark water.
Can it be possible?
What more is to be done?
It might have done me good.
It was right in front of us.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Oh, very well, he said.
Well then, be quick.
He must wait.
Nothing could have been better.
And what a voice she has.
What age is he?
Then it is certain?
And yet you are the better off?
Yes and no.
You can hear that, miss?
You brought no one with you?
Never mind that.
What is power?
But how long ago?
Then bring them to me, she said.
Oh, if men only knew.
Who gave it to you?
But what must be done?
That is possible.
Let her wait.
She gave me her hand.
But that is nothing to us.
Oh, of course.
Which box do you mean?
He left long ago.
Dont laugh.
It was so very long ago.
Will you rest here a little?
There was more to be done.
Yes, you are right.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Lead me to him.
Hold on a minute.
It is very clear.
Bring them here.
What has he done?
But they could see nothing.
What brought you here?
Then all was dark again.
What kind of voice is it?
Oh, that is very simple.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Is it possible?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
She was still game.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Let him go free?
Free to do what?
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Yes, that was a picture book.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
What have you done?
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
He has a good voice still.
Yes, what is it?
And he told you nothing?
All of this was possible.
Yes, that is true.
Bring this with you.
Wait and see.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
How is that done?
It is done.
Half the town was there.
Of course it is.
Let me see your plan.
The whole night the tree stood still.
And here is the note.
He will sleep an hour.
Decide if you are going back home.
Well, but where can he fly to?
They would cry.
And sit in the dark?
Oh, no.
Yes, and no.
Now we must wait.
Good to rest once in a way.
How was that possible?
The whole day had been hot.
They know nothing about it.
Wonder is it like that.
Oh, man.
Why should my father fly?
Is that possible?
Behind my bed.
He ran up to them.
It was a record run.
Of course she will.
Answer me that, miss.
Clear the table.
The snow is deep.
My mind was soon made up.
There is no possible way.
Leave the rest to me.
Yes, we know that.
Of course they will.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
It was a very dark night.
Well, miss?
is it come yet?
Oh, do as you like.
His plan is very simple.
It is nothing.
Yes, she was back.
Clear my name.
Yes, go on.
There is your old bed.
Yes, all right.
He began to laugh.
It is time for bed.
But let us see your plan.
and so he decide he go back home.
You must stay.
She heard and saw nothing.
Come quick.
What have they done?
Yes, to be sure.
Yes, said the old man.
Why does the boat go so fast?
The night was very dark.
They call him a fine boy.
