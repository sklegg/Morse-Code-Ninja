What is his name?
In what year?
Say no more about it.
Been back long?
It is great.
Are you here for good?
Try it on.
Give it to me, then.
Where could he be?
This is the first act.
You can help me here.
He will ask for it.
How on earth do you know?
She has a house?
It will take a little time.
Come and help me.
You see it every day.
Where are we to turn for help?
Then they will follow you?
Well, what do you think?
It must be where you put it.
Why is that?
Can you point it out to me?
What did you say your name was?
Here it is, he said.
Here is the way we put in the time.
The world is before you.
You must tell me.
And a very good thing, too.
And where was the place?
You think so?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
It is very kind of you.
Will you take me to her?
You must come now.
What do you play?
Where are you?
Do it for me.
Some day you may ask me about it.
How could she say such a thing.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
What you have just said is good, very good.
You can say what it is.
Is that right?
That is right.
Is she well?
It is all the same.
What did he tell you?
Ask him to show up?
Would you now like to look round my place?
Follow me, said the man.
That was a good time.
Why, what is it, then?
Too much for me now.
What would you have me do?
Then will come our time.
It is very high.
Say what you want.
And have you been here long?
But what does it mean?
You were near him.
That was a house to look at.
In what part of the house?
Well then, tell him so.
Where have they been?
She was the cause of it all.
Play with them.
Is there some for me?
One, two, three.
What do you mean?
We will say no more about it, then.
You will get on in the world.
Well, and what do you think?
Come with me, then.
Tell us your name.
Is he a good man?
Now, go home.
Will you try?
See, they are here.
The first act was over.
But what about me?
Have you been here long?
He said that that would help.
There she is again.
And what is her name?
Who are these men?
Do you know me?
Where did he come from?
You think so, too?
What do you think of him?
Just like me.
Is there no one who can help me?
Get out and play.
All right, then.
There is the little boy.
Tell me all about it.
But it is just so with the world.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
Then what kind is it?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
What does all this mean?
And where is this man?
Where to, now?
Now tell me.
He will live.
She has been with him many long years.
There is no place like home.
What have you been after?
Is that all you want?
Just look through it.
where did she come from?
Well, tell me.
Is this the man?
Well, here he is.
And what did she say?
Who will tell her?
We are who we say we are.
What did he say?
Are they like each other?
For how much?
What was his name?
And what did he say?
Where in the world did you come from?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Which house is it?
No, mother.
That is right, said the old man.
What a good thing it would be.
He has more to give.
Think of him.
And who is the man?
Read that, he said.
Well, read it.
What do they want?
To what end?
You are a good boy.
You know, you see right through people.
He went to him.
But he does so need a mother.
Get out of the way.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
What do you think of that?
Good day, one and all.
That is just my point.
Why are they here?
What do you want to ask these people?
It is the same thing.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
But where is he?
How did you get me out?
Think it over.
She had to tell him.
Do you think so?
Well, and is that all?
What do you want?
There, that does me good.
Will you come with me?
She came up to them.
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to do it?
If you want to know, go and find out.
Where do you live?
That would be very good.
What on earth do you mean?
Where are they off to now?
And what will they do with us?
And where is it?
And how in the world did you find them?
This is my point.
How do you take it?
That is all one can say about her.
Now it was time to act.
But this is the point.
Is he big?
Do you think she was?
And where is he now?
Good day to you.
There was work to do.
Now where did they come from?
Say no more.
Well, go on.
It was now his turn to look about him.
Can you take me?
What do they say was the cause?
Get to work.
We are here.
Hand it in.
Where have you been?
Such as what?
Is it you or me?
He was there too.
How old was she?
There will just be time.
He was so kind.
But where are we to go?
Take this and this.
How can you say that?
Well, how did it go?
Now we see the light.
And off we go.
She was right.
What was it you said to me?
Tell us all about it.
do you come from the end of the world?
What is your name?
What will you say?
Now, you know me.
Give him air.
Well, what do you think about it?
Were you here before me?
Well, did he?
How does she use you?
When will it take place?
Why do you want to know?
Do you think so now?
Where is she?
What on earth does this mean?
What is that in your hand?
Is it all right?
Very well then.
Where did you place it?
Show us where you live, said the man.
But why do you ask?
What does she think about me?
And what are they made of?
What is in your hand?
And it did me good.
What does she want?
What do you think of her?
Is it any good?
Give me my work.
Well, all right.
Three, he said.
Very well, show him to me.
Show me the way he went.
And how did you find out?
He went on his way.
But he is right.
Just look at her.
How can you tell?
What more could a man ask for?
He was here.
You must take me with you.
What does one live for?
Well, how are you?
Is it large?
Why did he come?
This for me?
Call me what you will, he said.
Where is he now?
Here is my hand.
How does he use it?
Give it me.
What do you mean by that?
Why do you want water?
Where are you off to?
Are you at it again?
Give me more than that
You are all very kind to me.
How did you get here?
Now come here.
After three, he said.
Here it is.
And where is she, then?
Where is he?
Only two there now.
Where does he live?
He was at work again.
this one, too?
And why is that?
Turn this way.
He is at my house.
We must come back.
Well then, what do you want?
When will he come back?
Tell me his name.
Too much of this.
Think no more about that.
At your house?
How can you think of such a thing?
Where are you from?
Read that, she said.
Where are we?
Look at it other way round.
There was no one near.
They are here.
They want more.
Give me a light.
And they went home.
But you must.
Tell me about it.
And what was his name?
What could set you off in the first place?
There is no one here to see.
And how old were you at that time?
Show me the way.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Did you tell him?
Tell me who made the world.
take them all.
What could she mean by it?
And that was the end of it.
Ask her, he said.
That is the end of her.
They had all been very good to us.
But where is it?
What did you say that for?
And in she went.
Why is he here?
Are you back again?
She went on.
How did that help you?
No, tell me.
Too much in the way.
Here she is.
Come with me.
And do you know why?
Show it to me.
What does it all mean?
Why are you here?
Time to get out.
Look at me.
How long have you been here?
Much good that would be.
Think what you will.
Why are you like this?
That was very good.
It would be very kind of you.
But who was your mother?
But what did you want?
It was high time.
What do you think of this?
Take some, she said.
Why, what do you mean?
Now, what do you want with me?
When will her mother come?
Can you help me find my way?
Is it as good now?
Large or small?
There is more to tell.
What will each of you give?
Then why are you here?
See, here it is.
And what do you think?
Who is that man?
Good, he said.
Very well, he said.
How much are they?
What does he mean?
And what about your mother?
How old are you?
He said too much.
You are right.
I would like to see her again in that.
there are only two.
All in good time.
For some man.
Move on, then.
You are most kind.
Where do they get that?
Go and try.
Put it on.
How can you find out?
Give me your hand.
But why do you ask me?
How much do you want?
This is the man.
Come with me to the little house.
