Do you remember?
Have you a family?
Then get ready at once.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Try it on the dog first.
You can pass through the door.
Why did it happen?
We had better go in.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
He knew them.
Ten, did you say?
Your watch is slow.
So do you, my love.
That may be true.
The rock was very small.
This money was for her.
It would be better if you went to the war.
And serve them right.
On fire, on fire.
You love him?
Let me also ask you a question.
Take notice.
What a state he was in.
Much of it was true.
Pass this way, then.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Why do we love?
Long and the short of it.
I have no children to love me.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Long live the king.
He had my love.
And that is the whole point.
One other question, said he.
What have you heard?
That was the rule, she said.
Is the wind north or south?
You had better go.
What size do you want?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
She told me all about it.
Is your man white or black?
Better cross here.
Did they ever go back?
The night was cold.
Are you here on leave?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
In an hour it will be at the door.
But he never heard me.
Do you remember me?
Can she sing?
So the question was, what to do?
It has been there ever since.
We are ready.
What can happen?
Are you still cold?
Pull together.
Look to the west.
How do you feel?
And you are still so young.
Do you want any money?
That is enough.
Did you get any money?
How could that happen?
A house is on fire?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Did you tell him your whole story?
Where are you off to so early?
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
But enough of this.
That would be the best way.
Have you heard from him often?
Listen to me.
He said, get him out of the road.
She is the first person in this house.
This is my body.
It is cold.
He had enough of it.
They had several children.
It would have been more simple.
Will you answer that question?
If you only knew.
When did this happen?
Do you remember him?
Are you better?
Take good care of the little girl.
Let me remember what he said.
Let us leave them, she said.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Then you will know me better.
Let that pass.
He said, the work is now complete.
Where he was, no one knew.
Little girl, where have you been?
And you can sing?
An example would be better.
There was no wind.
Made me feel so young.
Are they made to order?
you must step out.
He put his hand over part of the map.
How soon will he be here?
He will leave me.
We must make the best of it.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Now listen to me.
She was a good girl.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
And then he told all he knew.
Leave me out of the question.
They had heard all that before.
you know better than that.
But let that pass.
We knew them both.
But she is very young.
Against what side?
This was true.
Better write it here.
They left in the morning.
You know me well enough.
Light my fire.
Who was it told me his name?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Which king?
Hold her hand.
So we came down this road.
Do you love her much?
Well, young man?
Let me see him, said the young man.
Does he love you?
We will talk about that.
And why do you serve?
It was true to life.
And what does she want the money for?
But listen to this, he said.
It is the rule.
She knew what was good for children.
Had you heard?
You are right, young man.
Then what would happen?
Before you leave, tell us.
You must leave that to me.
Fire and water, earth and air.
He got it this morning.
You may leave the room.
Leave any for him?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
How does this happen?
But what did we ever get for it?
She had very little notice from him.
Let us talk a little about my father.
Do you love me?
We serve them.
He never heard.
She is much better.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
What is there to talk about?
Have you heard?
The King Went to him.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Keep in step.
How far from the body?
The night was cold and still.
We were up early.
To know her is to love her.
Read them, said the King.
You are better than that.
What will happen now?
She is fast?
What does he feel?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
And so they knew that it was true.
A young man?
They can have all our half of the house.
Take a hold of it.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Are you ready?
There are four hundred?
Are you ready to play?
You are right, my love.
What kind of a bird?
And will you direct us?
You were told.
You are a good girl.
You must travel.
Do you know that old lay?
Is that true?
Better late than never.
Ten will be early enough.
He is better than any of you.
The family was at home.
It was cold.
You will soon know.
Why talk to me?
Was he young or old?
Half a mile?
This is simple.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
How did this happen?
And so they began to talk.
But one day you must feel it.
They are still young.
Are we ready?
How many children did he leave?
Does she go fast?
That was the question.
He is very simple.
Let this man pass.
Did he though?
You may go, said the King.
You saw the person?
What have you against me now?
Let me hear from you soon.
It is a young girl.
And dont talk to me.
You remember the place, my father?
How do you feel now?
Have you told her?
Half as many is too much.
It was a round table.
It will interest you, said he.
You will always love him?
They all heard me.
She must be told.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
who told you you could?
But why must you leave me so soon?
Can you sing?
Feel better then.
Five young children.
This will pass in no time.
No more money?
When do you leave?
Do you own a dog?
In an hour?
From then on it was war between them.
They had much to talk about.
She was so young, too.
It is true.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Are you in love with her?
what could be better?
Every word you said was heard.
Pull it more to your side.
you should know her better than me.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
No, he is a man about my size.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
And how did he make his money?
Has she any family?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
An hour and a half.
You are cold.
Listen to this, will you?
Let us talk about you.
He never told us what it was she said.
Had they been heard?
We got her half way.
Where did they get the money from?
That is very simple.
She knew at once.
You are in love with me?
Put down three and carry five.
Listen to them, he said.
She is very plain.
Well, are you ready?
Leave off that.
A better man than you.
The world is big enough.
Never heard of him.
But how simple it is.
Listen to him.
But listen to me.
Never heard of it.
Now, listen.
Can it be true?
That is enough for me.
Why do you serve?
No less, no more.
That must be true.
They told me to.
Hold it up to the light.
That is true.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
It is a fire.
It was all she could do to hold in.
You are on a ship?
Who told you so?
What do you mean by that question?
She was only a little girl.
Answer me this one question.
It can never happen.
She told me to ask you.
Never heard of it before.
We dont know enough.
Young man, you will go far.
No, my love.
Why do they want to make her sing?
He has money.
It is a rock.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Are you all ready?
What is love?
You have an hour.
Let us pass.
In short, take me.
Ask them to sing one more song.
We call it black.
Remember that time?
They knew it.
Who told you that?
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Is your family well?
We had a list.
About the usual time.
It was true.
How does it feel?
If you know it, that is enough.
Is it true?
And you will always love him?
How short his time.
The dog is always with him.
As soon as you left, it began.
What will happen to us?
Your true father?
What a question.
