And when will you call?
And how did you find out?
What did they do?
Do you see him?
So there it was.
Did you know her?
So it is.
That was it.
No was there one?
That will do, said he.
But what have they been up to?
What is it about?
That is what she did.
And who is this?
That will do, he said.
Did you know them?
but we can go and see.
Do they know him?
What do you make of that?
How is she?
How is he now?
What are we to do?
Now there is no more to be said.
There he is, she said.
You can have some.
When is it?
But so it is.
There he is, do you see him?
What do they call you?
Do you know what you look like?
But it was of no use.
But when will that be?
When was it?
Are you there?
How did you know about it?
It was from you.
Will you come and see her?
Who will go first?
are you there?
One or two?
Do you like him?
How can you know?
They said no more.
Now what are we to do with you?
But what will you do?
No one will come, she said.
What can this be?
What was he like?
How did you come by it?
Did you see her?
How was that?
Go on, he said.
How would you like to have it?
But it has been so long.
Who is she?
Did you know him?
What is he like?
How can it be?
Would you like some?
But he had to have it.
He said no.
who can it be?
Come this way.
And do you like her?
Which is it?
Had to look the other way.
What was it?
But how is that?
Is she like him?
What is it like?
Look at it this way.
Look at them.
And is that all?
But what are you up to?
What is that?
Is it like him?
Then what are you up to now?
What DO you know of him?
But he had no time.
Who and what are you?
Do as you will.
What time is it?
There were two of them.
Who was that?
Will that do?
Look at him.
Now is your time.
Then what is it?
What will you do, then?
Has it come to this?
Do you know her?
At what number?
Then how many are there?
You may go.
Out of the way.
Then there is more to do.
But who was she?
You can go.
and so on, and so on.
And what was it for?
What did he do to you?
Look at it.
How did he do it?
Tqhen you may go.
You have it.
What are you up to?
You know more than we do.
What have you come for?
What is there to see?
There he is, you see.
Do you know?
How are you?
Is it over?
Who are you?
She has it.
And what did you do then?
Is that her?
So be it.
What is all this?
We have no water.
What do you see?
Do you know him?
Would you do what he did?
What can we do, then?
And has it come to this?
You have them?
but what if it is?
There they are.
And what is that?
Call him in.
Then, how do you know?
And who was that?
And what do you call her?
what has she to do with it?
And who are you?
But WHAT DID you see?
Do you see it?
Did you see it?
but there was more to it than this.
what is it?
That was all she said.
How do you do?
There you are, he said.
What could it be?
What did you do then?
How did she do it?
What is it for?
What is it all about?
When was that?
Who was he?
And could she see him?
Can it be?
Can you do that?
Is it time?
How long has he been there?
And what do you make of it?
Do as you like.
What would she have said?
So it was.
You know how it is with her.
How is he?
At what time?
What do you make of it?
What other way is there to look at it?
But how about you?
who, then, are you?
The time will come.
Is that it?
Then make it up.
We have him.
Look over it.
But what is it?
That is a long time.
Or so they said.
Do you know what it is?
But will he see it?
And do you like him?
What was it about?
May we come in?
Now you know.
And what did you see?
There you are.
You can do it.
There is but one thing to do.
Is he there?
Then who are you?
The time had come.
Is that all?
And all for what?
So that was the way.
Can one see from there?
There you are.
So that was the way.
May we come in?
You know how it is with her.
Then who are you?
But what are you up to?
What will you do, then?
Did you know her?
Is it like him?
Did you know them?
But who was she?
Will you come and see her?
But what will you do?
You can go.
What is it about?
Come this way.

What can we do, then?
Call him in.
What was he like?

That will do, he said.
That was it.
And who are you?
Who was that?
