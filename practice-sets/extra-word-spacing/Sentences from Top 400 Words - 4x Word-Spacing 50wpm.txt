Let us pass.
Does he love you?
But enough of this.
Before you leave, tell us.
What do you mean by that question?
Little girl, where have you been?
Never heard of it.
It was true.
Look to the west.
We had better go in.
Then get ready at once.
Five young children.
Listen to them, he said.
who told you you could?
It would be better if you went to the war.
Are you ready?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
From then on it was war between them.
This was true.
Made me feel so young.
It was true to life.
So the question was, what to do?
What will happen now?
We must try to find him, said the girl.
That may be true.
This money was for her.
What a state he was in.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
A house is on fire?
You have an hour.
He put his hand over part of the map.
Do you remember him?
There are four hundred?
A young man?
Better late than never.
But how simple it is.
The King Went to him.
Then what would happen?
As soon as you left, it began.
He had my love.
They had several children.
You are on a ship?
Can she sing?
We will talk about that.
Let us talk a little about my father.
Now listen to me.
A better man than you.
Pass this way, then.
But let that pass.
Better write it here.
We had a list.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Are you in love with her?
That is enough for me.
She knew what was good for children.
Why talk to me?
Have you heard?
You will always love him?
They can have all our half of the house.
It will interest you, said he.
Where are you off to so early?
you must step out.
Did you get any money?
It can never happen.
One other question, said he.
He had enough of it.
Never heard of it before.
You know me well enough.
Well, young man?
She is very plain.
Try it on the dog first.
Then you will know me better.
And dont talk to me.
What does he feel?
That is enough.
Every word you said was heard.
Do you love me?
And serve them right.
Are we ready?
Who was it told me his name?
what could be better?
And so they knew that it was true.
You saw the person?
Let us leave them, she said.
You had better go.
He got it this morning.
Are you ready to play?
It was cold.
She was so young, too.
He never heard.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
She was a good girl.
Feel better then.
Has she any family?
Do you remember me?
What have you against me now?
You may go, said the King.
We knew them both.
You are right, young man.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Your watch is slow.
Can you sing?
Young man, you will go far.
Where did they get the money from?
It was all she could do to hold in.
Never heard of him.
She had very little notice from him.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Was he young or old?
How far from the body?
They all heard me.
How did this happen?
Now, listen.
It is a fire.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
Let me see him, said the young man.
So we came down this road.
What can happen?
How many children did he leave?
The night was cold.
Remember that time?
How do you feel?
The family was at home.
And what does she want the money for?
Hold it up to the light.
They left in the morning.
The world is big enough.
It is true.
Do you know that old lay?
Had they been heard?
You love him?
The rock was very small.
He said, get him out of the road.
Hold her hand.
In an hour?
She is the first person in this house.
You remember the place, my father?
Let us talk about you.
Is your family well?
Is the wind north or south?
Do you want any money?
So do you, my love.
you should know her better than me.
You will soon know.
Take a hold of it.
Is it true?
Do you remember?
Why do you serve?
That was the rule, she said.
The night was cold and still.
No more money?
About the usual time.
Do you love her much?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Ten will be early enough.
Have you a family?
She told me all about it.
She must be told.
You are better than that.
Why do we love?
That must be true.
He has money.
Take notice.
She was only a little girl.
Half a mile?
Does she go fast?
But listen to this, he said.
Who told you so?
Long live the king.
We dont know enough.
What will happen to us?
It is cold.
Listen to him.
You may leave the room.
It is a rock.
But she is very young.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
This will pass in no time.
That is very simple.
It is a young girl.
How soon will he be here?
You are cold.
Which king?
That was the question.
Let me hear from you soon.
He will leave me.
What size do you want?
Are you all ready?
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
The dog is always with him.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Read them, said the King.
No less, no more.
We serve them.
Pull together.
And you will always love him?
They had much to talk about.
What is love?
They had heard all that before.
Light my fire.
Much of it was true.
Let that pass.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
It was a round table.
She is fast?
There was no wind.
When did this happen?
Listen to this, will you?
Leave me out of the question.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
It would have been more simple.
Half as many is too much.
It is the rule.
Did they ever go back?
Are you better?
Are you here on leave?
She is much better.
you know better than that.
Will you answer that question?
In short, take me.
You must travel.
She told me to ask you.
Long and the short of it.
Had you heard?
Did you tell him your whole story?
What is there to talk about?
What could we do if he were to leave us.
In an hour it will be at the door.
No, he is a man about my size.
They knew it.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Are they made to order?
Do you own a dog?
Listen to me.
Have you told her?
We got her half way.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
They are still young.
How do you feel now?
That is true.
Are you still cold?
And that is the whole point.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Fire and water, earth and air.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Why do they want to make her sing?
Pull it more to your side.
If you only knew.
Ask them to sing one more song.
Let me also ask you a question.
You are a good girl.
Well, are you ready?
But what did we ever get for it?
We call it black.
We were up early.
What a question.
He never told us what it was she said.
You are in love with me?
And you are still so young.
On fire, on fire.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Leave off that.
Let me remember what he said.
He is better than any of you.
To know her is to love her.
Where he was, no one knew.
And so they began to talk.
How could that happen?
Can it be true?
Is your man white or black?
It has been there ever since.
I have no children to love me.
You are right, my love.
Leave any for him?
And why do you serve?
And how did he make his money?
But one day you must feel it.
And then he told all he knew.
He is very simple.
He said, the work is now complete.
How short his time.
And will you direct us?
An example would be better.
But why must you leave me so soon?
Answer me this one question.
Put down three and carry five.
How does it feel?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
Take good care of the little girl.
What have you heard?
And you can sing?
An hour and a half.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Why did it happen?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
She knew at once.
We are ready.
Keep in step.
How does this happen?
This is simple.
What kind of a bird?
You can pass through the door.
He knew them.
If you know it, that is enough.
No, my love.
Against what side?
Better cross here.
Did he though?
Ten, did you say?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
That would be the best way.
But he never heard me.
Have you heard from him often?
Is that true?
You were told.
When do you leave?
We must make the best of it.
Who told you that?
This is my body.
They told me to.
Let this man pass.
But listen to me.
Your true father?
You must leave that to me.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
