Do you see him?
Is she like him?
Now there is no more to be said.
But it has been so long.
There he is, you see.
Do you know him?
At what time?
Then what is it?
We have him.
How can it be?
And what did you do then?
Do you like him?
And what do you make of it?
and so on, and so on.
No one will come, she said.
How did he do it?
Do you know what you look like?
You have it.
Look at him.
Call him in.
Can it be?
That is a long time.
That was all she said.
How is he now?
You can have some.
What other way is there to look at it?
What is all this?
What time is it?
Which is it?
Now you know.
Is it time?
Then there is more to do.
The time will come.
Can one see from there?
Who will go first?
There they are.
Who and what are you?
what is it?
And when will you call?
There he is, do you see him?
Did you know her?
It was from you.
But he had no time.
what has she to do with it?
How was that?
Do as you will.
Look at them.
When is it?
What DO you know of him?
Who was that?
but we can go and see.
And what was it for?
Do you know what it is?
How would you like to have it?
Come this way.
Who are you?
There you are.
But what have they been up to?
What is it for?
How can you know?
And could she see him?
There is but one thing to do.
That will do, said he.
We have no water.
That is what she did.
Did you know them?
Is that her?
So be it.
But how is that?
What did you do then?
The time had come.
What is it about?
They said no more.
That will do, he said.
Who is she?
How do you do?
What is he like?
What do you make of that?
May we come in?
But will he see it?
What do you make of it?
And who was that?
What could it be?
What do you see?
Did you see it?
Will you come and see her?
Then make it up.
You know how it is with her.
That was it.
But so it is.
And who are you?
How did you know about it?
Do you know her?
But who was she?
And how did you find out?
Now is your time.
But WHAT DID you see?
How is he?
She has it.
And who is this?
Are you there?
Or so they said.
There you are, he said.
What are you up to?
What did he do to you?
Is that all?
But what will you do?
There he is, she said.
How did she do it?
Look at it this way.
What is it all about?
Would you like some?
But what are you up to?
Who was he?
You may go.
What would she have said?
When was it?
How are you?
who can it be?
What was he like?
You know more than we do.
And do you like her?
Had to look the other way.
Look at it.
How long has he been there?
But he had to have it.
So it was.
But it was of no use.
So that was the way.
Look over it.
How is she?
He said no.
are you there?
What are we to do?
What have you come for?
And what do you call her?
but what if it is?
Then what are you up to now?
Do they know him?
When was that?
Go on, he said.
Tqhen you may go.
And do you like him?
And all for what?
who, then, are you?
Out of the way.
But how about you?
Did you see her?
What is it like?
What is there to see?
And what did you see?
What did they do?
Do as you like.
No was there one?
What was it about?
But when will that be?
Is he there?
Now what are we to do with you?
Has it come to this?
One or two?
And has it come to this?
So there it was.
So it is.
Will that do?
Did you know him?
You can do it.
Would you do what he did?
Can you do that?
And what is that?
Is it like him?
What was it?
What is that?
What do they call you?
Is that it?
Then how many are there?
You can go.
Then, how do you know?
There were two of them.
Then who are you?
And is that all?
Is it over?
but there was more to it than this.
Do you know?
At what number?
Do you see it?
What can we do, then?
What will you do, then?
What can this be?
But what is it?
How did you come by it?
You have them?
But what have they been up to?
Is she like him?
What is it all about?
Do you know?
Who was he?
Who are you?
But how about you?
Is it time?
There you are.
What is there to see?
Who will go first?
What are you up to?
Or so they said.
You can go.
Is it over?
What is he like?
Do they know him?
Then who are you?
How is he?
But who was she?
And has it come to this?
What would she have said?
May we come in?
You know how it is with her.
That is a long time.
What is it about?
Can one see from there?
That will do, he said.
What time is it?
So that was the way.
How is he now?
who can it be?
How is she?
You can do it.
What DO you know of him?
And what did you see?
You have them?
who, then, are you?
Do you know what you look like?
What did he do to you?
And who are you?
The time will come.
Who was that?
How did she do it?
So be it.
And what is that?
How did you know about it?
What can this be?
What could it be?
but we can go and see.
Did you see it?
You may go.
But WHAT DID you see?
But it was of no use.
How long has he been there?
Now you know.
Who is she?
So it is.
Go on, he said.
There you are, he said.
But will he see it?
You know more than we do.
Now there is no more to be said.
What other way is there to look at it?
But what are you up to?
are you there?
When is it?
You have it.
Do you see it?
Then there is more to do.
But when will that be?
At what time?
There they are.
Look at them.
He said no.
How was that?
Can you do that?
But what will you do?
Do you see him?
How can it be?
There he is, she said.
Look at it this way.
but there was more to it than this.
Do you know him?
Out of the way.
Is that all?
Did you know him?
How would you like to have it?
What was he like?
You can have some.
What is it like?
How did you come by it?
What do you see?
What did they do?
We have him.
But so it is.
Do you know what it is?
And what was it for?
We have no water.

No one will come, she said.
Then what are you up to now?
What are we to do?
What was it about?
Will that do?
And who was that?
Tqhen you may go.
Then make it up.
When was that?
What is it for?
Call him in.
Is that it?
What can we do, then?
Look at him.
What is that?
She has it.
What was it?
Has it come to this?
How did he do it?
what is it?
But he had no time.
And how did you find out?
And what do you call her?
Did you see her?
But he had to have it.
That was all she said.
No was there one?

Who and what are you?
Then, how do you know?

Would you do what he did?
And is that all?
Did you know them?
And all for what?
Will you come and see her?
When was it?
Now is your time.
There is but one thing to do.
And do you like her?
Now what are we to do with you?
