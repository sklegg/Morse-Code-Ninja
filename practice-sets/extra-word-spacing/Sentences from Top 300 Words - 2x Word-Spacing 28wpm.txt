What would you have me do with my life?
Well, what next?
Are you my friend?
And he left the room.
Watch him, he said.
There, do you hear?
We must go at once.
They are hard at it.
They dont know their own country.
Both of us.
They may tell us to open it.
We might learn a thing or two.
It was his own room.
Then, good night.
Do you hear me?
Have you got it?
How could you begin?
Come eat with me.
She is my friend.
There to the left.
What is life to you?
It was like new life to him.
At four, she said.
He saw his men draw back.
We should look at this.
To the left.
And there are four of you?
And now let us go home.
Life is all right.
Go to your father.
He is at sea.
What was it that you thought?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
In the country?
Have you been at sea?
How would they stop it?
It is always so.
Off with his head.
Let her go.
Let me look.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
No, never.
Who should it be?
So they got out and went in.
But what did you hear?
Who was the letter from?
But then you would be close to the sea?
But watch over him.
Point it at his horse.
Tell her to begin.
Does he never go out?
No, said the Tree.
Where is the river?
Will you never learn?
It is well thought of.
He has been been found.
They are always the same.
For once you are right.
Let me see her.
It must be in her own house.
My father is right.
We got under way at last.
Few had found it.
The sun had set long since.
Dont you think so?
Let us go back.
She never came back.
You are right, father.
Do you often come back?
Dont tell me.
We dont see it like that.
How did it begin?
Tell me more.
You are sure of that?
Let him grow up with you.
But it was very late.
And now, good night.
Who took him out of it?
And what did you learn from him?
What did he answer?
Dont move, he said.
It is from your father.
He is always at it.
Do you hear that?
He may come close.
Well, let us be sure of that.
It was white.
But now it is too late.
Take care of him.
What a night it has been.
And then they began to fish.
Keep watch all night.
Tell us a story.
How many children?
That night we were just in time.
Here is the book.
But you must never tell.
It might help.
Let me get on with my work.
Our own people must come first.
He had only one night more to live.
That was the first night.
Always the same, year after year.
Come at once.
And who is this friend?
Are you sure of it?
He has children of his own.
Where could you keep it?
Come, let us be men.
She came in just now by the back door.
They came over last night.
Can you stand?
We should ask him.
Are you sure?
But let us walk.
She saw no one?
Why do you stop here?
Why is he cross with me?
You must never tell.
He said at last.
Let us start, then.
So take care of me.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Any book will tell you that.
This took place at his house, in his room.
First turn to the left.
Good night again.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
She might be at his house.
Is it in the city?
it took all that time to come over the water.
How could you let him go so far?
We found it.
Dont say that to me.
And she left the room.
You have a car?
There was no letter for me.
Always the same with you people.
Think of my father.
Is he a real father?
It was the last day of the year.
But are you sure of that?
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
But then it will be too late.
By and by he got it.
And then we may begin.
Let me out.
Dont you see that?
You should take me there one day.
She must have a hard time with him.
Dont you like it?
Let me hear your story.
You must study.
Open the door.
We are together.
And this food?
You are sure of it?
Is it far?
Let me go to the door.
But it would be in the paper.
Let me see it.
Keep to the right.
There was no answer.
We were together.
Which story was it?
What was left of him?
It was then time to start.
Stop, said he.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
It is so very kind of you both.
A second man got up and went out.
what river is it?
They never did it again.
There is only food for one.
You saw him?
Now you must eat.
Here we see the boy at school.
Music is a good thing.
Let me get to work.
You might want it.
It is a long story.
Dont you want any?
One never has too much.
They never come back.
Do you know what he did last night?
He is my father.
Still, you never know.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Let me know at once when you will start.
Let us go in.
Let me hear what it is.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Is that far?
No, said her father.
Then let me have a word with you.
She is still here?
No, why should he?
And why should they?
No, dont.
Say good night.
Just cut it out, will you?
Never see him again.
Come let us see them.
One was on a white horse.
Are we late?
But they may still come here.
Do you know where he is?
It was the first thing he thought of.
Let me go back.
She got up.
We never thought of that.
What did you hear?
Let me have a word with you.
Cut your hand open?
At last we have a man.
But she saw no one?
Who can answer for that?
This is real.
Let me say one thing.
Right here it began.
Come here, my friend.
Now or never.
No, that can never be.
Why, dont you hear it?
There are only four of us.
Good for the country.
Let them have it.
Where has she run off to?
Can you hear me?
But it is the same with any life.
You got me?
So he began to help.
You will answer for it.
Do you want some more to eat?
Call the next one.
How much have you got?
Who said four?
Have you found it?
They always know.
He might still be up.
Have you never been there?
Let me see him.
It would seem so.
Do you know how he made his mark?
Stop, let me show you the way.
You must walk.
It was very hard.
Why, it was one of his own men.
At this time of my life, no.
Watch over him.
So it always was.
This is my country.
Good night, friend.
Keep to the left.
Stop and think.
Just cut it out.
Which end is his head?
What country does he come from?
It will be too late.
Off with her head.
He is my friend.
Cut him down.
So, once more, good night.
What do you think of the music?
Just a few.
What is your real name?
We are very far from that.
Well, run back to her.
That is the idea.
Come over in the sun.
And your children?
Why, is it late?
You must eat now.
Is my father here?
This took him some time.
Let me see him at once.
Write an answer.
If you know, why dont you tell?
But hard to tell.
Do you have a car?
What did he say in the letter?
The other night she left.
Why should this be so?
Sure of what?
He then said, It is time to start.
Let us cross over.
We got to let that go.
She saw it.
Do you have the letter?
What was the name of the man who took it?
What do you hear?
But you got to play music for them.
These were the first people we saw.
We may be too late.
It is open?
Now let me have it.
Who could have thought it?
Where have you been this long while?
We got one and they got one.
What should he say?
She came over last night.
There were few near me.
Give me the letter.
This is what began it all.
He could run no more.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
How many are left?
Do you want to cross?
Take care.
Do we stop here?
No, stop.
Did you see his eye?
You found him?
See him grow up.
But it is all all too late now.
Let me be and let me live.
When did you begin?
He had two left feet.
Have you got that?
Let him follow me.
Is there any answer?
They dont care.
A call for help, you thought?
And what did you do with that letter?
Who let you in?
Let him answer us.
Why dont you want to go?
Only, dont look back.
Where is this city?
Here is the paper.
But why dont you want to take it?
Look at his face.
It is music.
Why should they?
Who found them out?
Here he is at last.
Well, read the letter again.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
We must begin again.
He came at once.
Ask one of those men.
Who did you learn that from?
Here is the letter.
Why dont you play?
Was you in my room?
The children will live just the same.
You took it.
What a start that was.
But take care.
What do you think when you hear music?
Let me in.
One of us will be here all night.
Are we too late?
