They had several children.
Who told you so?
What have you against me now?
Let me hear from you soon.
And dont talk to me.
Little girl, where have you been?
Do you remember?
He put his hand over part of the map.
How does it feel?
In an hour it will be at the door.
Has she any family?
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Do you know that old lay?
That is enough.
Much of it was true.
It is a rock.
Was he young or old?
We got her half way.
Is it true?
On fire, on fire.
You are in love with me?
Is the wind north or south?
Who told you that?
So the question was, what to do?
Where did they get the money from?
The family was at home.
You must travel.
Never heard of him.
A house is on fire?
He never heard.
And how did he make his money?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
Did you get any money?
He said, the work is now complete.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
The rock was very small.
Before you leave, tell us.
Answer me this one question.
She knew what was good for children.
Will you answer that question?
You may leave the room.
Keep in step.
you should know her better than me.
Better cross here.
Can she sing?
He got it this morning.
And what does she want the money for?
You had better come to my house, said the man.
To know her is to love her.
There are four hundred?
But enough of this.
They had much to talk about.
No, my love.
So do you, my love.
Do you own a dog?
Pull it more to your side.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Leave me out of the question.
And that is the whole point.
Have you heard from him often?
Hold it up to the light.
Have you heard?
There was no wind.
Why do they want to make her sing?
He has money.
She was so young, too.
Against what side?
She is fast?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
You remember the place, my father?
Listen to this, will you?
That would be the best way.
You saw the person?
It is the rule.
He had enough of it.
Better write it here.
Long live the king.
He will leave me.
She is very plain.
Look to the west.
Where he was, no one knew.
Is your family well?
How do you feel?
No more money?
The night was cold.
A better man than you.
Are we ready?
Take notice.
Let this man pass.
Half as many is too much.
But listen to this, he said.
They had heard all that before.
Are you here on leave?
Your watch is slow.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
She told me all about it.
It was a round table.
But he never heard me.
We will talk about that.
Leave any for him?
Do you love her much?
No less, no more.
Let us talk a little about my father.
What can happen?
And so they knew that it was true.
In short, take me.
What does he feel?
She is the first person in this house.
It was cold.
who told you you could?
Take good care of the little girl.
Then you will know me better.
Pull together.
Can you sing?
Made me feel so young.
When did this happen?
Listen to them, he said.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Why talk to me?
Are you ready to play?
you know better than that.
Who was it told me his name?
She was a good girl.
She had very little notice from him.
One other question, said he.
About the usual time.
An example would be better.
That was the rule, she said.
Does she go fast?
Read them, said the King.
Pass this way, then.
Light my fire.
It would be better if you went to the war.
Well, are you ready?
She told me to ask you.
You must leave that to me.
Are you better?
In an hour?
Five young children.
Had they been heard?
Take a hold of it.
That is true.
It is a fire.
This is simple.
How do you feel now?
Did he though?
Why do you serve?
Leave off that.
That may be true.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
And you will always love him?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
What a question.
Let me remember what he said.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
But one day you must feel it.
How soon will he be here?
And serve them right.
What do you mean by that question?
What is there to talk about?
Have you told her?
You are better than that.
Hold her hand.
What will happen to us?
Ten will be early enough.
This will pass in no time.
you must step out.
Better late than never.
And so they began to talk.
But listen to me.
You know me well enough.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
You are cold.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
You are right, young man.
You are a good girl.
They knew it.
And will you direct us?
Do you want any money?
What size do you want?
They all heard me.
Do you remember me?
And you are still so young.
It will interest you, said he.
what could be better?
She was only a little girl.
Why do we love?
She knew at once.
Did you tell him your whole story?
Every word you said was heard.
You were told.
Your true father?
Had you heard?
I have no children to love me.
We dont know enough.
It was true.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Listen to me.
Why did it happen?
Do you love me?
That was the question.
Do you remember him?
If you only knew.
It is cold.
Let that pass.
This was true.
We had a list.
Are you ready?
So we came down this road.
Ten, did you say?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
It was true to life.
How many children did he leave?
Now listen to me.
Then get ready at once.
You are right, my love.
Did they ever go back?
We serve them.
Does he love you?
Long and the short of it.
He knew them.
He never told us what it was she said.
And then he told all he knew.
But why must you leave me so soon?
A young man?
Can it be true?
We call it black.
It is true.
Try it on the dog first.
You will soon know.
Now, listen.
Let us pass.
Are you in love with her?
You will always love him?
How does this happen?
Let us leave them, she said.
Which king?
How short his time.
This is my body.
That is very simple.
Put down three and carry five.
Are you all ready?
An hour and a half.
Have you a family?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Feel better then.
Ask them to sing one more song.
They are still young.
What have you heard?
What will happen now?
We had better go in.
As soon as you left, it began.
Listen to him.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
You can pass through the door.
Never heard of it.
Young man, you will go far.
And why do you serve?
You love him?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
You may go, said the King.
How could that happen?
But how simple it is.
He is very simple.
Are they made to order?
When do you leave?
And you can sing?
The world is big enough.
That must be true.
From then on it was war between them.
This money was for her.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
How far from the body?
It is a young girl.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
It would have been more simple.
The dog is always with him.
We must make the best of it.
That is enough for me.
We took our leave early, and left together.
She must be told.
They left in the morning.
You are on a ship?
Fire and water, earth and air.
What is love?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
We are ready.
What a state he was in.
We knew them both.
The night was cold and still.
Never heard of it before.
Are you still cold?
It has been there ever since.
We were up early.
If you know it, that is enough.
Well, young man?
Let me also ask you a question.
But let that pass.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
Let us talk about you.
Then what would happen?
Remember that time?
Is your man white or black?
Let me see him, said the young man.
They can have all our half of the house.
No, he is a man about my size.
Where are you off to so early?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Half a mile?
But what did we ever get for it?
The King Went to him.
She is much better.
He had my love.
They told me to.
You have an hour.
He said, get him out of the road.
You had better go.
How did this happen?
It can never happen.
What kind of a bird?
Is that true?
He is better than any of you.
But she is very young.
It was all she could do to hold in.
