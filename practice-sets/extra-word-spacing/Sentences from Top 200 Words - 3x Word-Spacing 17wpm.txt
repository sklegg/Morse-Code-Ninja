You are a good boy.
Where are they off to now?
This for me?
This is the first act.
Now, you know me.
There she is again.
Where are you from?
Well, all right.
To what end?
You know, you see right through people.
Is there some for me?
Why are they here?
What would you have me do?
Well, how did it go?
But who was your mother?
But it is just so with the world.
Give me more than that
It is very high.
Why do you want water?
There is the little boy.
How can you think of such a thing?
And what is her name?
Think it over.
Here it is.
And what did he say?
Where are we to turn for help?
In what year?
And what do you think?
Well, and is that all?
But why do you ask me?
Is this the man?
Do it for me.
Then will come our time.
And how old were you at that time?
You must tell me.
You must take me with you.
How does she use you?
That is right.
And that was the end of it.
Well, read it.
He said too much.
What does he mean?
Get out of the way.
And who is the man?
She had to tell him.
What do you want to ask these people?
Which house is it?
When will her mother come?
Look at me.
But where is he?
Just look at her.
What do you think of that?
It is the same thing.
What is that in your hand?
Now where did they come from?
there are only two.
Just like me.
You can help me here.
Is he big?
But what did you want?
But where is it?
Read that, she said.
Is it as good now?
Where do you live?
What do you play?
Do you think so now?
Tell us your name.
What does she want?
Why are you like this?
Say no more about it.
Say what you want.
You were near him.
Who will tell her?
And where is it?
Who is that man?
Been back long?
Is it any good?
It is now my turn to ask you why?
What will each of you give?
After three, he said.
When will it take place?
What did he tell you?
Were you here before me?
Well, what do you think about it?
Show me the way.
Is that right?
And what about your mother?
Come with me.
Move on, then.
Now it was time to act.
You will get on in the world.
Very well, he said.
Turn this way.
Then why are you here?
Time to get out.
What was it you said to me?
There will just be time.
But why do you ask?
Tell me all about it.
Get to work.
do you come from the end of the world?
Give it me.
No, tell me.
Give me a light.
We must come back.
Take some, she said.
What will you say?
How old are you?
Is that all you want?
It must be where you put it.
Are you back again?
Here is my hand.
Such as what?
Think what you will.
You think so?
Only two there now.
And off we go.
Too much of this.
He was at work again.
Did you tell him?
Ask him to show up?
Well, here he is.
Just look through it.
I would like to see her again in that.
He was so kind.
Come with me, then.
She was right.
She has been with him many long years.
All in good time.
Is there no one who can help me?
We will say no more about it, then.
Too much in the way.
Give it to me, then.
Too much for me now.
Here is the way we put in the time.
Show us where you live, said the man.
Some day you may ask me about it.
Give him air.
What do you want?
What you have just said is good, very good.
How can you find out?
Why did he come?
What did you say that for?
You are most kind.
What is in your hand?
Where did he come from?
See, here it is.
Now we see the light.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Where did you place it?
There is more to tell.
What do you think of this?
When will he come back?
this one, too?
Tell me his name.
Where have you been?
How long have you been here?
He is at my house.
And what will they do with us?
Tell us all about it.
But he is right.
Get out and play.
Then what kind is it?
What have you been after?
Now, what do you want with me?
Why is that?
At your house?
She went on.
That was very good.
It is great.
Follow me, said the man.
We are who we say we are.
How can you tell?
Can you help me find my way?
How does he use it?
How on earth do you know?
Much good that would be.
In what part of the house?
Where could he be?
What on earth do you mean?
Now, go home.
Why, what do you mean?
He was here.
How much are they?
Say no more.
He went on his way.
You can say what it is.
And what are they made of?
For how much?
He will ask for it.
Is it all right?
He went to him.
How do you take it?
But where are we to go?
What does she think about me?
Now tell me.
What does all this mean?
You are all very kind to me.
And do you know why?
But he does so need a mother.
Are they like each other?
What more could a man ask for?
Then they will follow you?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
How did that help you?
It will take a little time.
Well then, tell him so.
Is she well?
What was his name?
But this is the point.
And it did me good.
Will you take me to her?
Do you want me to do it?
Is it large?
It was high time.
Where is she?
Take this and this.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Well, did he?
And in she went.
And where was the place?
He has more to give.
Why is he here?
No, mother.
Can you take me?
That was a house to look at.
How old was she?
Is he a good man?
Read that, he said.
Think of him.
Go and try.
Why are you here?
Three, he said.
What could set you off in the first place?
Are you here for good?
But what about me?
What is his name?
Come with me to the little house.
Where do they get that?
Why do you want to know?
Can you point it out to me?
What did he say?
And where is he now?
Where are we?
There is no place like home.
That is just my point.
See, they are here.
Show it to me.
They had all been very good to us.
They are here.
You think so, too?
And where is she, then?
Put it on.
Ask her, he said.
That is all one can say about her.
If you want to know, go and find out.
What a good thing it would be.
This is the man.
Why, what is it, then?
That was a good time.
What on earth does this mean?
Do you think so?
Show me the way he went.
Well, tell me.
Will you come with me?
How much do you want?
Look at it other way round.
How did you get me out?
Good day to you.
What do you think of him?
Well, how are you?
Well, go on.
We are here.
She was the cause of it all.
She came up to them.
They want more.
Have you been here long?
It would be very kind of you.
She has a house?
Good day, one and all.
Good, he said.
That is the end of her.
What do you want me to do?
Where is he now?
He will live.
Give me my work.
Where in the world did you come from?
Here she is.
Where does he live?
Come and help me.
You must come now.
But what does it mean?
This is my point.
What do you think of her?
where did she come from?
That would be very good.
But you must.
take them all.
How could she say such a thing.
Where are you off to?
It is all the same.
What do you mean?
Well, and what do you think?
What does one live for?
Would you now like to look round my place?
Well then, what do you want?
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
What is your name?
Call me what you will, he said.
And have you been here long?
Well, what do you think?
What do you mean by that?
There, that does me good.
Who are these men?
How did you get here?
It was now his turn to look about him.
There was work to do.
The first act was over.
Very well, show him to me.
Where are you?
Will you try?
And how in the world did you find them?
He said that that would help.
What do they want?
Now come here.
He was there too.
Think no more about that.
Here it is, he said.
Tell me about it.
That is right, said the old man.
Where is he?
Do you think she was?
Very well then.
How can you say that?
What did you say your name was?
And what did she say?
Where have they been?
There was no one near.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
Try it on.
The world is before you.
And a very good thing, too.
One, two, three.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
And they went home.
You see it every day.
Play with them.
And what was his name?
And where is this man?
It is very kind of you.
For some man.
All right, then.
What do they say was the cause?
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Do you know me?
There is no one here to see.
Where to, now?
Hand it in.
What does it all mean?
What could she mean by it?
Large or small?
Is it you or me?
And why is that?
Tell me who made the world.
And how did you find out?
You are right.
Are you at it again?
Give me your hand.
