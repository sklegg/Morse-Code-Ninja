Never heard of it.
Then what would happen?
Leave any for him?
Why do they want to make her sing?
There was no wind.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Do you love me?
Fire and water, earth and air.
But why must you leave me so soon?
A young man?
About the usual time.
In an hour it will be at the door.
In an hour?
You remember the place, my father?
Then get ready at once.
Do you remember me?
And what does she want the money for?
You are a good girl.
She is very plain.
You must travel.
And you are still so young.
It is a rock.
If you only knew.
Read them, said the King.
Is that true?
It is the rule.
But let that pass.
Ten will be early enough.
It was all she could do to hold in.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
We had better go in.
Every word you said was heard.
What a question.
But listen to this, he said.
Are you in love with her?
Let us pass.
He never heard.
How could that happen?
What is there to talk about?
you must step out.
The night was cold.
I have no children to love me.
How far from the body?
How do you feel now?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
And then he told all he knew.
Why do we love?
It is a fire.
We will talk about that.
Why did it happen?
They told me to.
Are they made to order?
He had my love.
Let us talk a little about my father.
Is the wind north or south?
One other question, said he.
No, my love.
They all heard me.
Where did they get the money from?
who told you you could?
Well, young man?
This was true.
Five young children.
Where he was, no one knew.
Much of it was true.
And dont talk to me.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
Before you leave, tell us.
Answer me this one question.
Remember that time?
From then on it was war between them.
This is simple.
Have you a family?
But enough of this.
She knew at once.
It was true.
Where are you off to so early?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
When do you leave?
And why do you serve?
They left in the morning.
But listen to me.
How soon will he be here?
Let us leave them, she said.
Did you get any money?
An example would be better.
Who told you that?
That is enough.
He is very simple.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
How does this happen?
No less, no more.
She is fast?
Against what side?
She was only a little girl.
You are right, young man.
Hold her hand.
He is better than any of you.
They are still young.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
Listen to this, will you?
Did they ever go back?
You know me well enough.
Let me hear from you soon.
Put down three and carry five.
She knew what was good for children.
Why talk to me?
Can you sing?
Listen to him.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
He said, get him out of the road.
You saw the person?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Have you told her?
It is true.
We were up early.
Have you heard?
The family was at home.
Does he love you?
Your true father?
We took our leave early, and left together.
You may go, said the King.
Half a mile?
You love him?
Let us talk about you.
Are you ready to play?
We knew them both.
That must be true.
You must leave that to me.
Can she sing?
How does it feel?
It is a young girl.
It has been there ever since.
You are better than that.
And serve them right.
But he never heard me.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
So we came down this road.
He knew them.
What will happen now?
That would be the best way.
When did this happen?
Let this man pass.
On fire, on fire.
Leave off that.
You had better go.
Better write it here.
Are you still cold?
Take notice.
The King Went to him.
What have you against me now?
We dont know enough.
Do you own a dog?
you should know her better than me.
She had very little notice from him.
Which king?
Light my fire.
He has money.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
What can happen?
Now listen to me.
They knew it.
This is my body.
But how simple it is.
Have you heard from him often?
You will always love him?
What will happen to us?
She is much better.
He got it this morning.
We serve them.
He said, the work is now complete.
Young man, you will go far.
Let me also ask you a question.
Now, listen.
Let me see him, said the young man.
Are you ready?
Hold it up to the light.
you know better than that.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
What have you heard?
We are ready.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Do you want any money?
Are you all ready?
That is very simple.
We had a list.
You are on a ship?
The night was cold and still.
Take good care of the little girl.
But what did we ever get for it?
You are right, my love.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
We call it black.
Listen to them, he said.
They had heard all that before.
She is the first person in this house.
Was he young or old?
It would be better if you went to the war.
Let that pass.
Do you know that old lay?
And so they began to talk.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Half as many is too much.
And so they knew that it was true.
But one day you must feel it.
Long and the short of it.
Pull together.
Had you heard?
Will you answer that question?
Has she any family?
She was so young, too.
She must be told.
It was true to life.
The world is big enough.
How short his time.
How do you feel?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
She was a good girl.
It was cold.
You are cold.
How many children did he leave?
If you know it, that is enough.
Keep in step.
Ask them to sing one more song.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
We must make the best of it.
She told me to ask you.
That is enough for me.
Let me remember what he said.
In short, take me.
Look to the west.
Pull it more to your side.
This money was for her.
And you can sing?
She told me all about it.
Do you love her much?
Do you remember him?
Feel better then.
You can pass through the door.
That may be true.
What does he feel?
Do you remember?
That was the rule, she said.
You have an hour.
As soon as you left, it began.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Is your man white or black?
We got her half way.
That was the question.
You may leave the room.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
It was a round table.
Then you will know me better.
And that is the whole point.
Well, are you ready?
Pass this way, then.
No more money?
Long live the king.
That is true.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Does she go fast?
A better man than you.
And you will always love him?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
It can never happen.
And will you direct us?
There are four hundred?
An hour and a half.
It will interest you, said he.
Made me feel so young.
You are in love with me?
You will soon know.
Your watch is slow.
What a state he was in.
Are you better?
Never heard of him.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
What size do you want?
He had enough of it.
Had they been heard?
No, he is a man about my size.
What is love?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
A house is on fire?
Little girl, where have you been?
Take a hold of it.
Can it be true?
Is it true?
You were told.
Better cross here.
Never heard of it before.
Did you tell him your whole story?
They can have all our half of the house.
what could be better?
So do you, my love.
Are you here on leave?
The rock was very small.
They had much to talk about.
Who was it told me his name?
To know her is to love her.
So the question was, what to do?
And how did he make his money?
Better late than never.
He never told us what it was she said.
They had several children.
Are we ready?
Listen to me.
Ten, did you say?
The dog is always with him.
He put his hand over part of the map.
Did he though?
He will leave me.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
But she is very young.
Who told you so?
This will pass in no time.
It is cold.
How did this happen?
What kind of a bird?
Leave me out of the question.
What do you mean by that question?
Is your family well?
Why do you serve?
Try it on the dog first.
It would have been more simple.
