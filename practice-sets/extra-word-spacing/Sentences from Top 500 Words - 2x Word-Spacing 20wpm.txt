Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
In that town there is a street.
Laugh, if you will.
Just go to sleep.
He must be in the same boat as us.
Did he fall?
Is he in bed?
It is a real bed.
There is no possible way.
Fly, my friend.
Oh, dont ask me.
Behind my bed.
All right then, sit down.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Her voice was low.
He never said nothing.
It has to be done.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
This is a test.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Wonder if he has a name.
Oh, do you know?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Then it is certain?
Well, what does that lead up to?
Do you have my note?
It was hot.
Oh, if men only knew.
Nothing could have been better.
Are they on foot?
This voice was that of my father.
Did she fall?
It is very clear.
He left long ago.
Fine, very fine.
Hold on a minute.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
What a game.
It must be done at once.
The island was a mile long.
Oh, just listen.
No, nothing of the kind.
It was a record run.
Of course he was right.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
If only they would be quick.
You must stay with me.
Never mind that.
Oh, do the best you can.
Who gave it to you?
The old man gave no answer.
What has he done?
Yes, to be sure.
Sit down, said the old man.
And you can do nothing until then?
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
It was full of people.
Let her wait.
They all fall to the ground.
It was right in front of us.
Never mind me.
Wait and see.
He has a good voice still.
Did it all rest on me?
He had made up his mind.
But that is nothing to us.
Do you talk in your sleep?
He had, to be sure, done much.
Well, what about my plan?
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
You can hear that, miss?
Perhaps he did.
Of course she will.
But how long ago?
Yes, very well.
Come quick.
Like these in shape and size?
How long would you keep me in town?
Yes, it is true.
What have they done?
Yes, but what did she say?
Oh, but you were there?
It was a warm night.
Nothing new under the sun.
Oh, that is very simple.
Decide if you are going back home.
Yes, my love?
Of course they will.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
It stood behind the door.
And here is the note.
Well then, be quick.
Oh, come now.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Oh, all right.
Wait a second.
What have they done with my work?
It is no use, said a voice.
You will fall.
Of course it is.
Answer me that, miss.
You know you must say yes.
You brought no one with you?
How was it done?
That was well done.
My mind was soon made up.
A fine thing too.
You are free to do so.
Money is no object?
At his side was a large green box.
And he told you nothing?
Well, there he stood.
Take good note of it.
It must be done.
Oh, very well, he said.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Behind every book is a man.
Nothing had come of it.
Which box do you mean?
What has brought you here?
Is that possible?
Well, of course.
What is power?
That is possible.
You must have a rest.
It was brought to me.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Play the game out.
He saw nothing.
Oh, go on.
He gave me this paper.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Bring it here.
Oh, this is too much.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
See what you have done.
You can sleep here.
What age is he?
Yes, he said.
And yet you are the better off?
Yes, but only for you and me.
Is that a fact?
I hear his voice in the house.
Then he must be a wonder.
But it must be done soon.
You know nothing about it.
There was more to be done.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
He was here a minute ago.
Lead me to him.
It was done.
Nothing could be more simple.
Be quick, for the time is short.
He began to laugh.
There, by the wheel.
What more is to be done?
Yes, all right.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Well, sit down by me.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
He is in the box.
Oh, take me with you.
Oh, to be sure.
Oh, tell me.
Go back to bed.
Yes, he said, all of it.
It is done.
Go and rest.
Let him go free?
They would cry.
But what must be done?
How long ago?
It was a dark night.
Yes, that was a picture book.
My mind is made up.
That is a fact.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
It was a cold, dark night.
It is nothing.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
What kind of voice is it?
And what have you done to me?
Yes, she said.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Very well, wait a minute.
All was dark.
There is a lot of people.
Here is our plan.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
The night was dark.
Yes, and no.
That would be a fine thing.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Yes, there it is.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Go in there and drive them out.
He must wait.
Well, miss?
Yes, go on.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Never mind how he came here.
But she is nothing to me now.
Clear the table.
Why did you bring him here?
What have you done?
Sit down, he said.
They need a rest.
Wonder is it like that.
Look at that dark water.
How can a little dog laugh?
Bring this with you.
His first cry was for his father.
Keep clear of him.
And what a voice she has.
Did she stay long?
She got her hand free.
Better sit still.
Yes, once.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
The night was very dark.
And sit in the dark?
Well, but where can he fly to?
Yes, you are right.
It is time for bed.
Try to sleep.
And yet you said he had money.
All that for nothing?
You better stay here all night.
We are free to act and think.
How was that possible?
He stood up.
The water ran dry.
Again came the voice.
Stay where you are.
Wait for me.
Dont laugh.
Yes, go and find out.
Do you see that island?
You could see there was a story behind it.
She began to cry.
How is that done?
What did the letter contain?
Yes, what is it?
Yes, she was back.
Is my father in town?
Oh, nothing.
Bring them here.
Oh, man.
Yes, we know that.
He will sleep an hour.
Yes, said the old man.
Help me sit up.
Oh, do as you like.
It might have done me good.
Nothing she can eat?
Nothing is more simple.
There is your old bed.
He is among us.
Will you rest here a little?
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Oh, take those off.
Of course it might.
Good to rest once in a way.
Come, and we can rest together.
It is possible.
Well, sit down.
We must be quick.
Oh, no.
In a minute.
Let us sit down.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Quick, friend, quick.
It was very dark.
But wait a minute.
It was so long ago.
But never mind that.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Are you strong?
Half the town was there.
This made him wonder more and more.
Why should my father fly?
Yes, it did.
They know nothing about it.
Then lead the way.
Let me see your plan.
It was so very long ago.
Why, of course.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
The snow is deep.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
You are in my power.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Wonder what he does.
Get to bed.
Money is power.
Yes, she could sing that.
The whole night the tree stood still.
You love a certain person.
Oh, you are there.
There is no one in that room behind you.
But what then must be done?
Just let us go free.
His plan is very simple.
You knew it, and said nothing?
And then the game began all over again.
It is certain.
Be back in a minute.
What is done is done.
The whole day had been hot.
It was cold and dark.
Yes, sit down.
She could think of nothing more to say.
But let us see your plan.
It was a kind of language between us.
His will be done.
Well yes, you are right.
Where can you wait for me?
She gave me her hand.
What can be done?
It is all done.
Clear the way.
All of this was possible.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
They call him a fine boy.
He knew nothing.
Oh, of course.
She heard and saw nothing.
Is it certain?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
The city was soon behind me.
It is his voice.
Leave the rest to me.
Who brought you up?
Oh let me in.
No, nothing at all.
Yes and no.
Wait a minute.
We are more strong together.
Free to do what?
Oh, he is so kind.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Yes, that is true.
Oh, that.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
She was still game.
What brought you here?
Now we must wait.
We brought them in.
But they could see nothing.
Can it be possible?
is it come yet?
You must stay.
He brought it with him for us to see.
and so he decide he go back home.
Clear my name.
Yes, he did.
Is it possible?
Yes, of course.
There is nothing more to be said.
He ran up to them.
It was a very dark night.
Nothing at all.
Then all was dark again.
