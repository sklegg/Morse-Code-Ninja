Let us go back.
It might help.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
So he began to help.
Let me get on with my work.
They may tell us to open it.
You got me?
Let me be and let me live.
There are only four of us.
He is my friend.
There were few near me.
Here is the paper.
No, dont.
So, once more, good night.
How many are left?
Dont you like it?
What should he say?
It was like new life to him.
Well, read the letter again.
What do you think when you hear music?
Go to your father.
They always know.
Let them have it.
Why is he cross with me?
Just cut it out, will you?
One of us will be here all night.
Just cut it out.
And this food?
It is open?
Dont tell me.
But it is the same with any life.
Who found them out?
She might be at his house.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Come over in the sun.
Let me out.
He is my father.
Let me in.
Never see him again.
What a start that was.
You are right, father.
it took all that time to come over the water.
Do you hear that?
Let us cross over.
Call the next one.
Write an answer.
No, never.
Then let me have a word with you.
It will be too late.
The sun had set long since.
So take care of me.
How could you begin?
Who was the letter from?
But it was very late.
And now let us go home.
And she left the room.
What a night it has been.
Is that far?
You took it.
You are sure of that?
You will answer for it.
How would they stop it?
Have you never been there?
Let me go back.
That night we were just in time.
Watch him, he said.
No, stop.
And what did you learn from him?
It was then time to start.
Cut him down.
Will you never learn?
But why dont you want to take it?
Stop, let me show you the way.
Do you have a car?
Here he is at last.
At four, she said.
Let me go to the door.
They never come back.
Let me hear your story.
Dont you want any?
Why should this be so?
What country does he come from?
Have you got that?
And then we may begin.
Well, run back to her.
Can you stand?
But it would be in the paper.
Well, what next?
He is at sea.
What was left of him?
We should look at this.
No, that can never be.
She saw no one?
Have you found it?
And then they began to fish.
Is he a real father?
We might learn a thing or two.
Off with her head.
We were together.
He said at last.
Then, good night.
Come eat with me.
Just a few.
He had two left feet.
Why dont you play?
We must begin again.
This is my country.
She saw it.
Music is a good thing.
It was very hard.
How did it begin?
How much have you got?
Just set still and take it like a man.
What was the name of the man who took it?
You saw him?
Let me see him at once.
Are we late?
Stop and think.
It is so very kind of you both.
Which end is his head?
They are always the same.
Keep to the left.
Now let me have it.
He had only one night more to live.
Do you want some more to eat?
You might want it.
He saw his men draw back.
But take care.
There was no letter for me.
Is it in the city?
Do you often come back?
You should take me there one day.
Ask one of those men.
We got one and they got one.
Why, it was one of his own men.
Who can answer for that?
She is my friend.
And he left the room.
Was you in my room?
We must go at once.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
And why should they?
There was no answer.
My father is right.
See him grow up.
Tell us a story.
He came at once.
Dont move, he said.
Are you sure?
What did he say in the letter?
What would you have me do with my life?
Why dont you want to go?
And there are four of you?
And who is this friend?
Why do you stop here?
Off with his head.
But then it will be too late.
No, said the Tree.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
He has children of his own.
Still, you never know.
It is from your father.
And now, good night.
Always the same with you people.
Tell her to begin.
Can you hear me?
She is still here?
But let us walk.
Which story was it?
But what did you hear?
Say good night.
In the country?
He could run no more.
We never thought of that.
Now or never.
Now you must eat.
Give me the letter.
Both of us.
Right here it began.
Do you want to cross?
That was the first night.
Who should it be?
what river is it?
Where is the river?
You must walk.
Where is this city?
So they got out and went in.
Where have you been this long while?
Let me look.
It was the last day of the year.
What did he answer?
Our own people must come first.
Here is the book.
They dont know their own country.
Let me see him.
Do you have the letter?
You have a car?
Do we stop here?
Cut your hand open?
But you must never tell.
Always the same, year after year.
He then said, It is time to start.
Let me know at once when you will start.
Dont you think so?
Dont you see that?
It was the first thing he thought of.
At this time of my life, no.
Why, is it late?
Think of my father.
Few had found it.
Let her go.
But they may still come here.
Who let you in?
A second man got up and went out.
We are very far from that.
One was on a white horse.
This is what began it all.
Are you my friend?
Did you see his eye?
Let us go in.
Is there any answer?
To the left.
He might still be up.
What is life to you?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Is my father here?
Let me get to work.
We may be too late.
A call for help, you thought?
Are you sure of it?
Who could have thought it?
Come, let us be men.
We got to let that go.
But you got to play music for them.
They came over last night.
No, said her father.
You found him?
These were the first people we saw.
What do you think of the music?
No, why should he?
Do you hear me?
He may come close.
What is your real name?
Dont say that to me.
Why should they?
What did you hear?
She got up.
Let him grow up with you.
Here is the letter.
It was his own room.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Who took him out of it?
For once you are right.
By and by he got it.
Take care.
But watch over him.
Who did you learn that from?
Let me see it.
It must be in her own house.
Point it at his horse.
Good night, friend.
Sure of what?
And your children?
Here we see the boy at school.
But are you sure of that?
Are we too late?
It is always so.
Why, dont you hear it?
This took him some time.
She came in just now by the back door.
Watch over him.
It is well thought of.
He is always at it.
The other night she left.
Keep watch all night.
Do you know where he is?
Well, let us be sure of that.
How many children?
Come here, my friend.
Let me see her.
So it always was.
It would seem so.
This took place at his house, in his room.
But she saw no one?
Let me have a word with you.
She came over last night.
First turn to the left.
Come let us see them.
We dont see it like that.
It is a long story.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
Does he never go out?
Look at his face.
One never has too much.
But now it is too late.
He has been been found.
That is the idea.
How could you let him go so far?
Take care of him.
Good for the country.
Have you been at sea?
Let me hear what it is.
Have you got it?
We should ask him.
She must have a hard time with him.
They dont care.
But then you would be close to the sea?
There to the left.
Who said four?
Where could you keep it?
We found it.
They never did it again.
She never came back.
You must never tell.
Where has she run off to?
Let him follow me.
But it is all all too late now.
You must study.
Keep to the right.
Life is all right.
Only, dont look back.
The children will live just the same.
Any book will tell you that.
Stop, said he.
It is music.
You are sure of it?
Let me say one thing.
Good night again.
What do you hear?
Let him answer us.
We are together.
We got under way at last.
You must eat now.
One night more and he would be on his way.
But hard to tell.
There is only food for one.
This is real.
Do you know what he did last night?
Open the door.
Let us start, then.
At last we have a man.
Is it far?
It was white.
Come at once.
There, do you hear?
Tell me more.
And what did you do with that letter?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
They are hard at it.
When did you begin?
Do you know how he made his mark?
What was it that you thought?
If you know, why dont you tell?
