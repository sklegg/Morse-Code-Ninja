Where have you been?
there are only two.
Would you now like to look round my place?
You think so?
There is no one here to see.
Are you here for good?
See, they are here.
What does she think about me?
Why did he come?
But this is the point.
But where is he?
You are all very kind to me.
Now come here.
No, mother.
It would be very kind of you.
How old was she?
Move on, then.
You see it every day.
Much good that would be.
Well, here he is.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Where is he?
What do you play?
What do you mean?
Here she is.
One, two, three.
Can you point it out to me?
How did you get me out?
Show me the way he went.
What on earth do you mean?
Now, go home.
Where to, now?
Why are you here?
How can you tell?
There, that does me good.
Give it to me, then.
It must be where you put it.
They want more.
Where in the world did you come from?
Put it on.
What does all this mean?
Who are these men?
How do you take it?
It is very kind of you.
And off we go.
What was his name?
What did you say your name was?
Are you at it again?
He was at work again.
Give me your hand.
And what did she say?
Will you take me to her?
What a good thing it would be.
But where is it?
Will you try?
Take this and this.
Where did you place it?
Can you help me find my way?
Where have they been?
What do you think of him?
At your house?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Is it as good now?
Well, read it.
Well, go on.
Too much for me now.
Where is she?
Which house is it?
Think it over.
Do you think she was?
Where are we?
Where are they off to now?
Give it me.
Tell us your name.
Take some, she said.
But he does so need a mother.
But what did you want?
Then what kind is it?
He has more to give.
And where was the place?
What do they want?
Such as what?
Just look at her.
Tell me who made the world.
What did he tell you?
I would like to see her again in that.
Look at me.
You were near him.
Why is he here?
Then will come our time.
Here is the way we put in the time.
Well, how did it go?
Where do you live?
Well, all right.
There was no one near.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
There she is again.
Tell me about it.
Very well, show him to me.
You are right.
Think what you will.
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Get out and play.
And how old were you at that time?
How can you think of such a thing?
Hand it in.
He was here.
And what is her name?
When will it take place?
When will her mother come?
Well then, what do you want?
Now, you know me.
Tell me his name.
Is this the man?
Is it large?
This is my point.
What was it you said to me?
He was so kind.
Ask him to show up?
Is that all you want?
How did you get here?
All right, then.
And what was his name?
What you have just said is good, very good.
And what are they made of?
He went on his way.
Now it was time to act.
And how in the world did you find them?
What could set you off in the first place?
Tell me all about it.
Been back long?
You must come now.
It was now his turn to look about him.
If you want to know, go and find out.
There is more to tell.
Is it any good?
No, tell me.
But it is just so with the world.
That is the end of her.
He was there too.
Is she well?
Will you give this to the old man over there?
And where is it?
Ask her, he said.
Come and help me.
Well, and what do you think?
What is that in your hand?
Get out of the way.
Is he a good man?
Time to get out.
What will you say?
How can you find out?
And do you know why?
Here is my hand.
Come with me.
That is all one can say about her.
Do you want me to do it?
Too much of this.
Is it all right?
And it did me good.
How long have you been here?
Three, he said.
And what do you think?
But where are we to go?
Can you take me?
Show us where you live, said the man.
And what about your mother?
What do you think of her?
Give me more than that
You are a good boy.
You know, you see right through people.
To what end?
Now where did they come from?
And in she went.
Think no more about that.
And where is he now?
And they went home.
Why are they here?
Who is that man?
Why, what is it, then?
Where do they get that?
This is the first act.
What is your name?
But what does it mean?
How can you say that?
Good day, one and all.
Go and try.
The first act was over.
She went on.
Give me a light.
And who is the man?
It will take a little time.
Why do you want water?
And where is she, then?
Well then, tell him so.
What do you mean by that?
It is all the same.
She was the cause of it all.
Why do you want to know?
Did you tell him?
How old are you?
You can say what it is.
What does it all mean?
It was high time.
Where are you off to?
She has a house?
She was right.
The world is before you.
Do you know me?
What do you think of this?
You think so, too?
Then why are you here?
Where did he come from?
And that was the end of it.
Is there some for me?
Too much in the way.
What do you want to ask these people?
And what did he say?
When will he come back?
this one, too?
How could she say such a thing.
Why, what do you mean?
Then they will follow you?
Say what you want.
What does one live for?
And why is that?
Good day to you.
What will each of you give?
That would be very good.
Now tell me.
Is there no one who can help me?
Where are we to turn for help?
And have you been here long?
After three, he said.
Give me my work.
do you come from the end of the world?
What more could a man ask for?
He will live.
Say no more.
What is in your hand?
Very well then.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
All in good time.
Only two there now.
Some day you may ask me about it.
What does he mean?
You must tell me.
Is it you or me?
There was work to do.
He is at my house.
What do they say was the cause?
There is the little boy.
They are here.
take them all.
Well, how are you?
But why do you ask me?
In what part of the house?
It is the same thing.
Do you think so now?
Here it is, he said.
How does she use you?
Why are you like this?
And a very good thing, too.
It is great.
And where is this man?
Look at it other way round.
Where are you from?
How does he use it?
He said too much.
It is very high.
We must come back.
But why do you ask?
Think of him.
How on earth do you know?
What do you want?
We are here.
We will say no more about it, then.
You are most kind.
Have you been here long?
Come with me to the little house.
Read that, she said.
What did he say?
What does she want?
She came up to them.
where did she come from?
Show it to me.
For how much?
Now we see the light.
You can help me here.
What do you think of that?
What do you want me to do?
Give him air.
There is no place like home.
Here it is.
That is just my point.
Is he big?
Play with them.
This is the man.
They had all been very good to us.
Where does he live?
Turn this way.
But he is right.
But what about me?
In what year?
Why is that?
Now, what do you want with me?
Read that, he said.
He went to him.
Follow me, said the man.
Just look through it.
Well, and is that all?
And what will they do with us?
That is right, said the old man.
Were you here before me?
That was very good.
That was a house to look at.
Do it for me.
Well, what do you think?
Tell us all about it.
Well, tell me.
What could she mean by it?
Where is he now?
She has been with him many long years.
And how did you find out?
What would you have me do?
Are you back again?
See, here it is.
Where could he be?
Large or small?
What did you say that for?
What is his name?
Well, what do you think about it?
Are they like each other?
Try it on.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
That was a good time.
Where are you?
Good, he said.
She had to tell him.
This for me?
Well, did he?
He said that that would help.
Show me the way.
Say no more about it.
But you must.
Will you come with me?
Call me what you will, he said.
You will get on in the world.
How much do you want?
How much are they?
There will just be time.
How did that help you?
But who was your mother?
What on earth does this mean?
Do you think so?
For some man.
Just like me.
Get to work.
Come with me, then.
He will ask for it.
Is that right?
We are who we say we are.
Very well, he said.
That is right.
You must take me with you.
What have you been after?
Who will tell her?
