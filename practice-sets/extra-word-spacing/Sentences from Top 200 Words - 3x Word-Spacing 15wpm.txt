Now we see the light.
Why, what is it, then?
Tell me his name.
Time to get out.
What did he say?
there are only two.
She was the cause of it all.
Good day to you.
There is the little boy.
He said that that would help.
Been back long?
That is just my point.
What does she think about me?
What do you want me to do?
Well, read it.
What did he tell you?
What on earth do you mean?
It is very high.
When will he come back?
And what are they made of?
Is he big?
What does it all mean?
Now, you know me.
What does one live for?
Well then, tell him so.
If you want to know, go and find out.
And how old were you at that time?
Call me what you will, he said.
Did you tell him?
Where did he come from?
After three, he said.
And why is that?
When will her mother come?
Is this the man?
Come with me, then.
We are who we say we are.
There will just be time.
When will it take place?
Read that, she said.
Here she is.
And off we go.
And what was his name?
You are right.
How can you say that?
Only two there now.
The first act was over.
How can you find out?
But what did you want?
Where are we to turn for help?
What do you want to ask these people?
Where are you from?
Do you think so now?
Where have they been?
Put it on.
Where are you?
What will each of you give?
Too much of this.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Hand it in.
Think it over.
But he is right.
Is it you or me?
Why are you here?
Where is she?
You can help me here.
And what will they do with us?
Give it to me, then.
But you must.
Why is he here?
What would you have me do?
How did that help you?
But this is the point.
And that was the end of it.
Large or small?
But where is he?
What a good thing it would be.
Will you try?
The world is before you.
Come and help me.
Are you at it again?
What was it you said to me?
Give me my work.
Well, what do you think?
Play with them.
No, tell me.
You know, you see right through people.
That is right.
You are most kind.
What is in your hand?
We will say no more about it, then.
But why do you ask me?
This for me?
He is at my house.
Tell me all about it.
Do it for me.
How old was she?
That was a good time.
Well, and what do you think?
We are here.
What do you want?
She came up to them.
And they went home.
What is your name?
But who was your mother?
What is that in your hand?
Then what kind is it?
What do you mean by that?
Can you help me find my way?
Move on, then.
Can you take me?
It is great.
Ask her, he said.
At your house?
Show us where you live, said the man.
Is that right?
Is there some for me?
Where in the world did you come from?
Well, go on.
There she is again.
In what year?
Think of him.
Is that all you want?
Why is that?
What more could a man ask for?
Show me the way.
And what did she say?
What do you think of this?
Why do you want water?
Where do they get that?
What do they say was the cause?
It will take a little time.
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
No, mother.
Take this and this.
What was his name?
You must come now.
This is the first act.
Give it me.
Come with me to the little house.
But why do you ask?
take them all.
You see it every day.
Very well, show him to me.
Too much for me now.
Give me your hand.
And where is she, then?
Are you back again?
Were you here before me?
Get out and play.
What will you say?
Now, go home.
That was a house to look at.
They had all been very good to us.
He was there too.
And who is the man?
Is there no one who can help me?
Do you think she was?
In what part of the house?
She went on.
He will ask for it.
Try it on.
What do you mean?
Where have you been?
Good, he said.
She has a house?
And where is it?
That is all one can say about her.
What do you think of her?
And it did me good.
How old are you?
Why do you want to know?
Tell us all about it.
But where is it?
And how in the world did you find them?
Will you come with me?
Just look at her.
Much good that would be.
Where are they off to now?
Here it is.
What do you think of him?
What do they want?
It is the same thing.
Where is he?
That was very good.
He was at work again.
What could set you off in the first place?
There is no place like home.
Such as what?
Come with me.
Are you here for good?
Who is that man?
Three, he said.
He said too much.
Very well, he said.
And where is he now?
But it is just so with the world.
What have you been after?
What could she mean by it?
She had to tell him.
Do you know me?
Give me a light.
Is it any good?
One, two, three.
You can say what it is.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
Now where did they come from?
Ask him to show up?
How did you get me out?
Well, how did it go?
What on earth does this mean?
What did you say your name was?
All right, then.
Well, did he?
What is his name?
You think so, too?
Give me more than that
And how did you find out?
See, they are here.
Well then, what do you want?
For how much?
And in she went.
And what about your mother?
See, here it is.
How long have you been here?
Now tell me.
He went to him.
Too much in the way.
You are all very kind to me.
And have you been here long?
We must come back.
Get to work.
Is he a good man?
You were near him.
Now it was time to act.
And what did he say?
How on earth do you know?
Where are you off to?
Just like me.
Well, how are you?
Very well then.
You will get on in the world.
Why did he come?
How can you tell?
Would you now like to look round my place?
Then why are you here?
It is very kind of you.
But what about me?
Say what you want.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
And do you know why?
It was now his turn to look about him.
Tell us your name.
Well, what do you think about it?
You must tell me.
Is it as good now?
Where could he be?
do you come from the end of the world?
They are here.
You think so?
How can you think of such a thing?
Take some, she said.
Think no more about that.
Which house is it?
That is the end of her.
Well, and is that all?
How could she say such a thing.
How much do you want?
Tell me about it.
You are a good boy.
Look at me.
Do you want me to do it?
Read that, he said.
Where do you live?
Some day you may ask me about it.
Here is my hand.
How does he use it?
Then they will follow you?
What do you think of that?
Show it to me.
He went on his way.
Is she well?
Turn this way.
It was high time.
He will live.
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
And what is her name?
There was work to do.
Is it all right?
But what does it mean?
where did she come from?
Tell me who made the world.
What does she want?
Why are you like this?
She has been with him many long years.
He was here.
But he does so need a mother.
Well, here he is.
Where is he now?
Think what you will.
And where is this man?
You must take me with you.
Can you point it out to me?
Is it large?
There was no one near.
And where was the place?
Get out of the way.
But where are we to go?
Why are they here?
That is right, said the old man.
How did you get here?
Are they like each other?
Just look through it.
How do you take it?
Now come here.
Say no more about it.
It is all the same.
Where did you place it?
What does all this mean?
And what do you think?
Where are we?
Who are these men?
She was right.
Why, what do you mean?
Give him air.
He was so kind.
That would be very good.
What did you say that for?
Good day, one and all.
Follow me, said the man.
Here it is, he said.
Go and try.
Where does he live?
Show me the way he went.
There is no one here to see.
He has more to give.
Well, all right.
What does he mean?
I would like to see her again in that.
Now, what do you want with me?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
They want more.
Will you take me to her?
It must be where you put it.
What you have just said is good, very good.
There is more to tell.
Do you think so?
Say no more.
How much are they?
Look at it other way round.
For some man.
this one, too?
There, that does me good.
All in good time.
What do you play?
Here is the way we put in the time.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
It would be very kind of you.
Who will tell her?
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
To what end?
Then will come our time.
Well, tell me.
Have you been here long?
Where to, now?
This is my point.
How does she use you?
This is the man.
And a very good thing, too.
