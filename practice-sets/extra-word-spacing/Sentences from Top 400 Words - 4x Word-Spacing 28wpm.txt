So do you, my love.
He is better than any of you.
But she is very young.
What does he feel?
She told me all about it.
Did they ever go back?
Much of it was true.
Who told you that?
You know me well enough.
It is cold.
Then you will know me better.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Which king?
Do you remember me?
Put down three and carry five.
A young man?
He never told us what it was she said.
A house is on fire?
What size do you want?
An example would be better.
Try it on the dog first.
You may go, said the King.
And that is the whole point.
She had very little notice from him.
You will soon know.
Why talk to me?
Are you ready?
And so they knew that it was true.
Let us leave them, she said.
Have you told her?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
But what did we ever get for it?
They knew it.
Listen to me.
No more money?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
It can never happen.
The family was at home.
Take a hold of it.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Young man, you will go far.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
She must be told.
You may leave the room.
And serve them right.
Now listen to me.
But listen to this, he said.
She is very plain.
You are better than that.
Before you leave, tell us.
That is enough for me.
He knew them.
What will happen now?
Let this man pass.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Against what side?
That is enough.
She told me to ask you.
She was only a little girl.
Your true father?
Now, listen.
Is it true?
Never heard of it before.
And you can sing?
That may be true.
And dont talk to me.
On fire, on fire.
Can she sing?
They had heard all that before.
Is your family well?
She was a good girl.
Can it be true?
You can pass through the door.
He never heard.
Let me hear from you soon.
We are ready.
Have you heard?
Did he though?
They told me to.
We must make the best of it.
What do you mean by that question?
Ask them to sing one more song.
That was the question.
That would be the best way.
What can happen?
You are a good girl.
They had much to talk about.
Feel better then.
The night was cold.
He got it this morning.
You have an hour.
Fire and water, earth and air.
It was true.
Five young children.
Pass this way, then.
Well, young man?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
No, my love.
What will happen to us?
Why do they want to make her sing?
You have your whole life before you, she said.
What have you heard?
Do you remember him?
We had a list.
How does this happen?
If you only knew.
Keep in step.
But listen to me.
Does he love you?
Leave me out of the question.
The world is big enough.
Hold her hand.
How short his time.
And then he told all he knew.
It has been there ever since.
She knew at once.
It is a rock.
Better late than never.
They are still young.
You were told.
It would be better if you went to the war.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
Have you a family?
Hold it up to the light.
What have you against me now?
Did you tell him your whole story?
And why do you serve?
We serve them.
Half a mile?
We got her half way.
Take good care of the little girl.
Is that true?
And so they began to talk.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Pull it more to your side.
A better man than you.
Leave off that.
Leave any for him?
That is true.
How does it feel?
Let us talk about you.
Every word you said was heard.
Who was it told me his name?
And you will always love him?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
You are in love with me?
No less, no more.
Well, are you ready?
She is much better.
He has money.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
What is there to talk about?
You are cold.
Read them, said the King.
There are four hundred?
He will leave me.
The rock was very small.
The King Went to him.
What kind of a bird?
you must step out.
Then get ready at once.
You remember the place, my father?
Why did it happen?
You are right, my love.
How did this happen?
Do you want any money?
you know better than that.
How soon will he be here?
We call it black.
Has she any family?
You love him?
It was all she could do to hold in.
Ten, did you say?
In short, take me.
It was a round table.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Let me remember what he said.
How do you feel now?
They can have all our half of the house.
It is the rule.
Listen to him.
So we came down this road.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
That must be true.
Why do you serve?
Are you ready to play?
They had several children.
She is the first person in this house.
Listen to this, will you?
This is simple.
Take notice.
Half as many is too much.
Are you in love with her?
About the usual time.
Is the wind north or south?
How far from the body?
You had better go.
Better cross here.
Let me also ask you a question.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
You are on a ship?
Then what would happen?
And what does she want the money for?
But enough of this.
Ten will be early enough.
The night was cold and still.
Your watch is slow.
They all heard me.
In an hour?
So the question was, what to do?
How could that happen?
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
This will pass in no time.
Better write it here.
We knew them both.
Where are you off to so early?
He had enough of it.
Answer me this one question.
Long live the king.
who told you you could?
Are you all ready?
Are you here on leave?
We had better go in.
In an hour it will be at the door.
And how did he make his money?
Can you sing?
Where he was, no one knew.
She was so young, too.
It was true to life.
what could be better?
From then on it was war between them.
Let us pass.
Listen to them, he said.
Have you heard from him often?
As soon as you left, it began.
The dog is always with him.
Had you heard?
It will interest you, said he.
Had they been heard?
Is your man white or black?
How do you feel?
Who told you so?
Are you better?
Light my fire.
We dont know enough.
Never heard of him.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Let me see him, said the young man.
But one day you must feel it.
Let us talk a little about my father.
When do you leave?
Do you own a dog?
And you are still so young.
If you know it, that is enough.
Do you remember?
Why do we love?
There was no wind.
What a state he was in.
He said, get him out of the road.
Made me feel so young.
She knew what was good for children.
Do you know that old lay?
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
But he never heard me.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Where did they get the money from?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
He is very simple.
This is my body.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Did you get any money?
He said, the work is now complete.
You saw the person?
Was he young or old?
You are right, young man.
Does she go fast?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
That is very simple.
One other question, said he.
To know her is to love her.
Are they made to order?
We were up early.
Do you love me?
He put his hand over part of the map.
This money was for her.
It was cold.
And will you direct us?
Remember that time?
What is love?
I have no children to love me.
You must travel.
An hour and a half.
you should know her better than me.
Look to the west.
You will always love him?
Are you still cold?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
This was true.
But let that pass.
But why must you leave me so soon?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Little girl, where have you been?
Pull together.
Never heard of it.
You must leave that to me.
Are we ready?
Let that pass.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
But how simple it is.
That was the rule, she said.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
No, he is a man about my size.
It is a young girl.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
What a question.
Do you love her much?
Long and the short of it.
How many children did he leave?
It would have been more simple.
We will talk about that.
He had my love.
She is fast?
When did this happen?
They left in the morning.
It is a fire.
Will you answer that question?
It is true.
