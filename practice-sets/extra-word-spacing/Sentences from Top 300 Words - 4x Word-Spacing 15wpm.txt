Which story was it?
A call for help, you thought?
We are very far from that.
Let me get on with my work.
Here we see the boy at school.
But it was very late.
You took it.
It was then time to start.
Have you never been there?
It would seem so.
They dont know their own country.
And then they began to fish.
We got to let that go.
You should take me there one day.
We dont see it like that.
What did he answer?
Just cut it out.
You must never tell.
Music is a good thing.
What should he say?
No, said the Tree.
Who took him out of it?
Let me say one thing.
Watch him, he said.
She came in just now by the back door.
She saw no one?
This is my country.
But you must never tell.
But watch over him.
He might still be up.
Who said four?
what river is it?
Have you got it?
He had no idea how long he had been there.
She might be at his house.
In the country?
Our own people must come first.
Who could have thought it?
It is open?
No, dont.
And now, good night.
Let me go back.
And there are four of you?
It is a long story.
It is so very kind of you both.
You found him?
Let me look.
They are always the same.
Why dont you play?
He is at sea.
Where has she run off to?
But she saw no one?
It might help.
It is music.
And this food?
One never has too much.
Dont you see that?
And why should they?
It is always so.
What a night it has been.
So it always was.
Open the door.
Can you stand?
What was it that you thought?
We got under way at last.
Will you never learn?
You got me?
Off with his head.
Good night, friend.
The other night she left.
Are you my friend?
Let him follow me.
But it would be in the paper.
Dont you want any?
Did you see his eye?
Well, what next?
Stop, said he.
What did you hear?
He had only one night more to live.
Let us start, then.
What is life to you?
What a start that was.
There is only food for one.
It was like new life to him.
So they got out and went in.
This is real.
By and by he got it.
How many are left?
Why is he cross with me?
So he began to help.
We must begin again.
He saw his men draw back.
Dont you think so?
Let me see her.
Let him answer us.
Let me be and let me live.
Go to your father.
But then you would be close to the sea?
What is your real name?
Why, it was one of his own men.
What do you think of the music?
Cut your hand open?
Why do you stop here?
My father is right.
Do you want some more to eat?
A second man got up and went out.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
One of us will be here all night.
Let us go back.
We may be too late.
Write an answer.
Then let me have a word with you.
What do you hear?
Here is the letter.
There was no answer.
And she left the room.
Let us go in.
Let me see him.
For once you are right.
We never thought of that.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
Do you want to cross?
No, why should he?
Say good night.
Keep to the right.
You are sure of that?
Can you hear me?
Think of my father.
Few had found it.
You are sure of it?
Which end is his head?
Well, run back to her.
How could you let him go so far?
She never came back.
Keep watch all night.
We got one and they got one.
Let me in.
He could run no more.
Both of us.
Well, read the letter again.
He is always at it.
There were few near me.
You will answer for it.
How much have you got?
Let him grow up with you.
Come over in the sun.
Was you in my room?
Any book will tell you that.
Does he never go out?
Stop and think.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
So, once more, good night.
Do you often come back?
Where could you keep it?
Right here it began.
What was left of him?
Good night again.
Still, you never know.
But then it will be too late.
Let us cross over.
These were the first people we saw.
Call the next one.
Do we stop here?
She is still here?
Let me go to the door.
Dont you like it?
Who let you in?
How did it begin?
How could you begin?
It was his own room.
Now you must eat.
Let her go.
Do you have a car?
There to the left.
He then said, It is time to start.
Here is the paper.
Tell me more.
Why dont you want to go?
He has been been found.
But let us walk.
Never see him again.
See him grow up.
But are you sure of that?
Point it at his horse.
Always the same, year after year.
Who found them out?
Now or never.
We should look at this.
Who was the letter from?
She came over last night.
Is he a real father?
One night more and he would be on his way.
Is my father here?
Keep to the left.
Where have you been this long while?
Just cut it out, will you?
Then, good night.
Dont move, he said.
And he left the room.
No, never.
Who should it be?
Where is this city?
Let me know at once when you will start.
He may come close.
Let me have a word with you.
To the left.
No, that can never be.
Where is the river?
Let me hear your story.
Dont tell me.
Do you know how he made his mark?
This is what began it all.
it took all that time to come over the water.
Have you been at sea?
Let me see it.
Do you hear me?
They always know.
Are you sure?
They came over last night.
But why dont you want to take it?
He has children of his own.
What did he say in the letter?
And what did you learn from him?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
And then we may begin.
It was the last day of the year.
But it is the same with any life.
One was on a white horse.
He had two left feet.
You saw him?
You are right, father.
What do you think when you hear music?
Let me out.
Is it far?
You have a car?
At four, she said.
It was white.
No, said her father.
They are hard at it.
It will be too late.
Why, dont you hear it?
Well, let us be sure of that.
We must go at once.
But it is all all too late now.
It is from your father.
It must be in her own house.
There, do you hear?
They may tell us to open it.
Why, is it late?
This took place at his house, in his room.
Are we too late?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Let me get to work.
He is my father.
We should ask him.
Do you know what he did last night?
Give me the letter.
Cut him down.
What would you have me do with my life?
First turn to the left.
Life is all right.
What was the name of the man who took it?
How would they stop it?
Is there any answer?
You must eat now.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Come let us see them.
They dont care.
And your children?
It was the first thing he thought of.
Just set still and take it like a man.
They never did it again.
She is my friend.
Take care.
Do you hear that?
Let me see him at once.
Let me hear what it is.
When did you begin?
The children will live just the same.
And who is this friend?
He is my friend.
That is the idea.
He said at last.
We were together.
Who did you learn that from?
What country does he come from?
So take care of me.
Do you know where he is?
Who can answer for that?
Come eat with me.
Dont say that to me.
Have you got that?
Are we late?
Stop, let me show you the way.
We might learn a thing or two.
Is that far?
But now it is too late.
But hard to tell.
We are together.
Now let me have it.
He came at once.
Look at his face.
There was no letter for me.
And now let us go home.
This took him some time.
Come here, my friend.
Sure of what?
That was the first night.
Just a few.
The sun had set long since.
Come, let us be men.
At last we have a man.
You might want it.
Why should this be so?
Here he is at last.
Come at once.
Ask one of those men.
She must have a hard time with him.
How many children?
She saw it.
But you got to play music for them.
It is well thought of.
Off with her head.
They never come back.
But they may still come here.
Is it in the city?
Are you sure of it?
No, stop.
Tell us a story.
She got up.
Do you have the letter?
We found it.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Why should they?
Tell her to begin.
Good for the country.
At this time of my life, no.
There are only four of us.
That night we were just in time.
Let them have it.
Take care of him.
You must walk.
But what did you hear?
If you know, why dont you tell?
Watch over him.
Always the same with you people.
And what did you do with that letter?
It was very hard.
Only, dont look back.
Here is the book.
Have you found it?
But take care.
You must study.
