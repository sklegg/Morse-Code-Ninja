Where is he now?
That is all one can say about her.
What do you want to ask these people?
Think what you will.
Time to get out.
Here is my hand.
The world is before you.
And why is that?
You can help me here.
We will say no more about it, then.
Well then, what do you want?
Give me a light.
Come with me to the little house.
It is great.
What have you been after?
And who is the man?
Would you now like to look round my place?
No, tell me.
What is in your hand?
Here she is.
See, they are here.
Well then, tell him so.
She came up to them.
Which house is it?
That is right, said the old man.
You will get on in the world.
Well, how are you?
What on earth do you mean?
Now where did they come from?
What does one live for?
Who is that man?
You know, you see right through people.
Now tell me.
I would like to see her again in that.
What will you say?
For some man.
And in she went.
Go and try.
Give him air.
Where are we to turn for help?
That would be very good.
Why is he here?
Were you here before me?
Show me the way.
Just look at her.
She had to tell him.
He was here.
Where do you live?
You are all very kind to me.
He went on his way.
Where have you been?
But this is the point.
Show it to me.
Why do you want water?
Why, what is it, then?
Look at me.
What did he tell you?
It would be very kind of you.
You were near him.
What more could a man ask for?
And what do you think?
She was the cause of it all.
What do you mean by that?
How long have you been here?
Well, read it.
If you want to know, go and find out.
Look at it other way round.
Who are these men?
Where are we?
Good day to you.
And what is her name?
Play with them.
And a very good thing, too.
Think no more about that.
Well, tell me.
What did you say your name was?
Read that, he said.
What do they want?
How did you get me out?
Well, how did it go?
There is no place like home.
When will it take place?
Good day, one and all.
This is the first act.
take them all.
How on earth do you know?
This is the man.
Why is that?
Can you point it out to me?
Get to work.
Well, here he is.
Well, what do you think?
Where does he live?
Have you been here long?
Can you help me find my way?
He was so kind.
What would you have me do?
What on earth does this mean?
Come with me, then.
This for me?
Large or small?
Say no more about it.
Now come here.
Follow me, said the man.
That is the end of her.
Much good that would be.
It is all the same.
Come and help me.
No, mother.
Some day you may ask me about it.
What does she think about me?
Is there some for me?
They had all been very good to us.
Look at it, and tell me what you think of it.
This is my point.
Now what is it that you came to me to say?
Move on, then.
Tell us your name.
And what about your mother?
Now we see the light.
Then will come our time.
Now, what do you want with me?
How can you think of such a thing?
Here it is.
Is that all you want?
That was a house to look at.
this one, too?
What do you think of him?
You must take me with you.
There is more to tell.
Do you think so now?
Do you think so?
It was now his turn to look about him.
And how old were you at that time?
What is his name?
There was work to do.
What do you think of her?
Is it any good?
Three, he said.
You are a man, and it is a man we want.
Say what you want.
They want more.
Why are you here?
Do you want me to go and tell him?
Do it for me.
She went on.
What do you think of that?
Where are you?
That is just my point.
That is right.
Where are you from?
What did he say?
Very well, he said.
What is that in your hand?
After three, he said.
And that was the end of it.
Can you take me?
Are you back again?
Why are you like this?
What does he mean?
Do you think she was?
Too much in the way.
How does he use it?
Very well then.
You are a good boy.
He said that that would help.
Is she well?
That was very good.
But where is it?
But you must.
Only two there now.
But where is he?
Is that right?
And what did she say?
And it did me good.
And off we go.
Well, go on.
Turn this way.
How could she say such a thing.
Give it me.
How old was she?
Say no more.
What is your name?
There will just be time.
And what was his name?
Will you take me to her?
What does it all mean?
Put it on.
You must tell me.
Tell me who made the world.
Too much of this.
The first act was over.
It is very high.
Think of him.
What did you say that for?
He was there too.
How did you get here?
Where could he be?
Read that, she said.
But what did you want?
How much are they?
But if that is so, what is there to live for?
Where did he come from?
He was at work again.
Where is he?
There was no one near.
Take some, she said.
What was his name?
Now, go home.
He has more to give.
How did that help you?
Where did you place it?
Tell me all about it.
Are they like each other?
For now the only thing we can do is go home.
Call me what you will, he said.
What do they say was the cause?
Well, and is that all?
Who will tell her?
It was high time.
Did you tell him?
It is the same thing.
What does all this mean?
But who was your mother?
He said too much.
But what does it mean?
See, here it is.
Get out and play.
Do you want me to do it?
What do you want me to do?
But what about me?
Try it on.
Why did he come?
But it is just so with the world.
How much do you want?
Well, did he?
Very well, show him to me.
Is it all right?
Just look through it.
What you have just said is good, very good.
It is very kind of you.
We must come back.
Will you try?
What do you mean?
And where is he now?
Are you here for good?
How can you say that?
They are here.
Why are they here?
Is this the man?
Where are you off to?
You must come now.
Been back long?
Just like me.
Why, what do you mean?
Where are they off to now?
We are who we say we are.
She was right.
Take this and this.
Where do they get that?
At your house?
What could she mean by it?
Are you at it again?
Here it is, he said.
But where are we to go?
Where have they been?
He is at my house.
Ask him to show up?
She has been with him many long years.
How can you tell?
Get out of the way.
In what part of the house?
Ask her, he said.
And do you know why?
Then what kind is it?
Is it as good now?
Now, you know me.
You think so?
Well, what do you think about it?
Think it over.
Is he a good man?
And how in the world did you find them?
Good, he said.
Give me more than that
How can you find out?
What was it you said to me?
And they went home.
It must be where you put it.
Well, all right.
All right, then.
Is it you or me?
Show me the way he went.
In what year?
do you come from the end of the world?
You can say what it is.
Will you give this to the old man over there?
But he does so need a mother.
there are only two.
Then they will follow you?
There, that does me good.
Is he big?
You see it every day.
How old are you?
Why do you want to know?
What does she want?
But he is right.
You think so, too?
Where is she?
And where is it?
How do you take it?
Then why are you here?
Well, and what do you think?
Such as what?
Tell me his name.
Where to, now?
When will her mother come?
where did she come from?
He will ask for it.
You are most kind.
How does she use you?
And what did he say?
For how much?
You are right.
And where was the place?
Is there no one who can help me?
He went to him.
Now it was time to act.
When will he come back?
Give it to me, then.
Tell us all about it.
Too much for me now.
Give me my work.
Will you come with me?
Hand it in.
There she is again.
Do you know me?
We are here.
It will take a little time.
It is now my turn to ask you why?
And what are they made of?
Where in the world did you come from?
Give me your hand.
And how did you find out?
Is it large?
Tell me about it.
But why do you ask?
What do you think of this?
There is the little boy.
What do you play?
What do you want?
Come with me.
Show us where you live, said the man.
What a good thing it would be.
Here is the way we put in the time.
What will each of you give?
She has a house?
That was a good time.
But why do you ask me?
And where is this man?
And have you been here long?
And what will they do with us?
All in good time.
One, two, three.
He will live.
What could set you off in the first place?
And where is she, then?
To what end?
There is no one here to see.
