Yes, once.
Yes and no.
Yes, go on.
What a game.
Well, what about my plan?
Oh, that.
Of course they will.
Yes, what is it?
Behind every book is a man.
The snow is deep.
Money is power.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Let me see your plan.
Be quick, for the time is short.
This voice was that of my father.
Then all was dark again.
It is a real bed.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
His first cry was for his father.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Will you rest here a little?
Of course it is.
Help me sit up.
What is power?
It was so very long ago.
What age is he?
Very well, wait a minute.
We are free to act and think.
All that for nothing?
Yes, said the old man.
The night was very dark.
is it come yet?
It is possible.
Let us sit down.
Of course he was right.
And what a voice she has.
Oh, do you know?
Yes, we know that.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Which box do you mean?
It stood behind the door.
It was a kind of language between us.
Well, of course.
That is possible.
That would be a fine thing.
She began to cry.
Leave the rest to me.
Now we must wait.
Wait a second.
Is it possible?
It was a record run.
You must stay with me.
Well yes, you are right.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
It was so long ago.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Oh, but you were there?
Yes, he said, all of it.
But it must be done soon.
Oh, that is very simple.
Free to do what?
Of course it might.
But she is nothing to me now.
Oh, man.
What has brought you here?
There, by the wheel.
It is certain.
Oh, this is too much.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
But that is nothing to us.
Yes, that is true.
Oh, how can you sleep?
She heard and saw nothing.
There is your old bed.
Yes, and no.
Get to bed.
Yes, sit down.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Who brought you up?
It is his voice.
They all fall to the ground.
Be back in a minute.
and so he decide he go back home.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Oh, to be sure.
Like these in shape and size?
Lead me to him.
Well, sit down by me.
He saw nothing.
It was very dark.
Yes, very well.
It was a cold, dark night.
What have you done?
What kind of voice is it?
Yes, but only for you and me.
And you can do nothing until then?
Yes, it is true.
Let him go free?
How is that done?
He must be in the same boat as us.
Oh, if men only knew.
Oh, no.
She was still game.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Dont laugh.
You brought no one with you?
It was a very dark night.
He is in the box.
Hold on a minute.
But what must be done?
Did she stay long?
Nothing had come of it.
You will fall.
Oh, dont ask me.
No, nothing of the kind.
Look at that dark water.
Come quick.
But how long ago?
Bring it here.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
You know you must say yes.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Yes, there it is.
Answer me that, miss.
You can hear that, miss?
Yes, she was back.
Clear the table.
It was brought to me.
Oh, he is so kind.
You could see there was a story behind it.
He gave me this paper.
Wait and see.
Go back to bed.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
In her name, then, let it be done.
She got her hand free.
Are you strong?
Half the town was there.
Yes, all right.
The city was soon behind me.
Wonder what he does.
He is among us.
And then the game began all over again.
Who gave it to you?
Well, there he stood.
What is done is done.
You love a certain person.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
There is no possible way.
He has a good voice still.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Let her wait.
Nothing could have been better.
It was full of people.
But wait a minute.
No, nothing at all.
The little boy lay in his bed.
It was done.
What did the letter contain?
Behind my bed.
Nothing at all.
You know nothing about it.
There is a lot of people.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
How was that possible?
She gave me her hand.
It was a warm night.
That was well done.
This made him wonder more and more.
What can be done?
Are they on foot?
The whole day had been hot.
We are more strong together.
It is no use, said a voice.
Take good note of it.
He had made up his mind.
Good to rest once in a way.
In a minute.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Oh, tell me.
You are free to do so.
They know nothing about it.
Nothing she can eat?
How long would you keep me in town?
Yes, my love?
He had, to be sure, done much.
It is nothing.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Oh, come now.
Oh, do as you like.
His plan is very simple.
He stood up.
It must be done at once.
It is time for bed.
All of this was possible.
But what then must be done?
Bring them here.
Decide if you are going back home.
Yes, go and find out.
Wait for me.
Can it be possible?
Why did you bring him here?
Come, let me show you my plan.
It is done.
He ran up to them.
Oh, go on.
Quick, friend, quick.
They need a rest.
You knew it, and said nothing?
Is that a fact?
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
He never said nothing.
And yet you are the better off?
There is nothing more to be said.
But let us see your plan.
Oh, take those off.
Wonder if he has a name.
Yes, she said.
The whole night the tree stood still.
And here is the note.
All right then, sit down.
At his side was a large green box.
Just let us go free.
This is a test.
What have they done with my work?
He left long ago.
I hear his voice in the house.
It was right in front of us.
They would cry.
My mind is made up.
And he told you nothing?
You can sleep here.
Nothing new under the sun.
The island was a mile long.
Well then, be quick.
Again came the voice.
Go in there and drive them out.
And what have you done to me?
A fine thing too.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
You are in my power.
Yes, you are right.
My mind was soon made up.
Perhaps he did.
It was hot.
Well, miss?
What brought you here?
Never mind that.
How long ago?
People might know my voice and find me out.
Yes, he said.
What more is to be done?
He must wait.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Fine, very fine.
Never mind me.
Why should my father fly?
The night was dark.
Yes, it did.
Oh, very well, he said.
Clear the way.
Is it certain?
Stay where you are.
It was a dark night.
Her voice was low.
Of course she will.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Oh, is he on land or sea?
It is very clear.
All was dark.
Oh, just listen.
Oh, you are there.
Sit down, said the old man.
You better stay here all night.
Did it all rest on me?
Wonder is it like that.
Come, and we can rest together.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Here is our plan.
Oh let me in.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Is that possible?
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
He began to laugh.
In that town there is a street.
We brought them in.
It might have done me good.
Nothing could be more simple.
Oh, do the best you can.
Where can you wait for me?
Yes, of course.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
And yet you said he had money.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Do you have my note?
Why, of course.
He brought it with him for us to see.
Try to sleep.
It has to be done.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
Oh, of course.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Do you see that island?
There was more to be done.
Then he must be a wonder.
Is he in bed?
But never mind that.
Oh, nothing.
Yes, she could sing that.
But they could see nothing.
Sit down, he said.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
It must be done.
If only they would be quick.
His will be done.
How can a little dog laugh?
Never mind how he came here.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Then it is certain?
Why does the boat go so fast?
How was it done?
Fly, my friend.
Nothing is more simple.
Go and rest.
What have they done?
Then bring them to me, she said.
Then lead the way.
Did he fall?
Wait a minute.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
He will sleep an hour.
Well, sit down.
It was cold and dark.
Laugh, if you will.
The water ran dry.
Clear my name.
He was here a minute ago.
Bring this with you.
Yes, he did.
What has he done?
Oh, all right.
And sit in the dark?
She got up, and ran out of the room.
The old man gave no answer.
Better sit still.
See what you have done.
That is a fact.
You must have a rest.
Yes, to be sure.
They call him a fine boy.
Did she fall?
He knew nothing.
Just go to sleep.
We must be quick.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Money is no object?
Oh, take me with you.
Yes, but what did she say?
Keep clear of him.
It is all done.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Is my father in town?
You must stay.
Play the game out.
