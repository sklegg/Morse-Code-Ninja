How short his time.
That must be true.
They are still young.
And that is the whole point.
Every word you said was heard.
Is your family well?
Are you in love with her?
Are you ready?
The dog is always with him.
Do you remember?
Let us talk a little about my father.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
That is very simple.
Light my fire.
Pull it more to your side.
He is better than any of you.
It would have been more simple.
But he never heard me.
There was no wind.
Are you here on leave?
Take a hold of it.
He said, the work is now complete.
And dont talk to me.
They knew it.
Have you heard from him often?
Was he young or old?
We must try to find him, said the girl.
you should know her better than me.
That was the question.
Then you will know me better.
Listen to them, he said.
He never told us what it was she said.
No more money?
Listen to me.
She is fast?
They had heard all that before.
Ten, did you say?
What have you heard?
What will happen to us?
As soon as you left, it began.
She told me all about it.
You saw the person?
you know better than that.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Did he though?
She is very plain.
But why must you leave me so soon?
Which king?
We got her half way.
A house is on fire?
What have you against me now?
She was a good girl.
He got it this morning.
If you only knew.
Are we ready?
No, my love.
Now, listen.
Is your man white or black?
You are in love with me?
Where did they get the money from?
You can pass through the door.
Then what would happen?
In an hour?
Will you answer that question?
It is a rock.
Who told you that?
Never heard of it.
Look to the west.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
A young man?
Are you better?
One other question, said he.
In an hour it will be at the door.
It is a fire.
Had they been heard?
And why do you serve?
They all heard me.
What is there to talk about?
It would be better if you went to the war.
Long and the short of it.
Never heard of him.
Leave any for him?
Try it on the dog first.
You are right, my love.
No, he is a man about my size.
Hold her hand.
Why did it happen?
You remember the place, my father?
We call it black.
An hour and a half.
Half a mile?
This is simple.
They had much to talk about.
Are they made to order?
what could be better?
What does he feel?
You are better than that.
Has she any family?
Is that true?
And serve them right.
Now listen to me.
Why do you serve?
Do you love me?
He has money.
That was the rule, she said.
How could that happen?
She was only a little girl.
She told me to ask you.
I have no children to love me.
That would be the best way.
What a state he was in.
Ten will be early enough.
How did this happen?
Answer me this one question.
She was so young, too.
But what did we ever get for it?
She knew what was good for children.
And you are still so young.
It has been there ever since.
We dont know enough.
You must travel.
He had enough of it.
He put his hand over part of the map.
What a question.
Let us leave them, she said.
You are a good girl.
Who told you so?
It is cold.
The King Went to him.
Let me also ask you a question.
We serve them.
Pull together.
This will pass in no time.
You must leave that to me.
Listen to him.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
And then he told all he knew.
It is true.
They can have all our half of the house.
It is a young girl.
To know her is to love her.
Feel better then.
What is love?
What kind of a bird?
What will happen now?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
You will soon know.
Half as many is too much.
The rock was very small.
And you will always love him?
The family was at home.
Where he was, no one knew.
On fire, on fire.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
But one day you must feel it.
They had several children.
Did you get any money?
Who was it told me his name?
That is enough.
Is the wind north or south?
She is much better.
What can happen?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
We must make the best of it.
It was true to life.
It was cold.
It was true.
He had my love.
She knew at once.
Let me hear from you soon.
Do you want any money?
It is the rule.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
But let that pass.
Have you told her?
Young man, you will go far.
Your true father?
You may leave the room.
Hold it up to the light.
The world is big enough.
But enough of this.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
Do you love her much?
Where are you off to so early?
Are you all ready?
Does he love you?
Much of it was true.
He said, get him out of the road.
How far from the body?
You have an hour.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
How does it feel?
So do you, my love.
That is true.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Why do we love?
Did they ever go back?
Take notice.
She must be told.
You are on a ship?
How do you feel?
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
How many children did he leave?
And you can sing?
Never heard of it before.
And so they knew that it was true.
He never heard.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
He will leave me.
A better man than you.
What size do you want?
Five young children.
And so they began to talk.
Have you heard?
Are you still cold?
It can never happen.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
She had very little notice from him.
How does this happen?
Have you a family?
We are ready.
Why do they want to make her sing?
How do you feel now?
You will always love him?
The night was cold.
Take good care of the little girl.
What do you mean by that question?
Read them, said the King.
When did this happen?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
That is enough for me.
Are you ready to play?
When do you leave?
Let me remember what he said.
Long live the king.
Fire and water, earth and air.
Can you sing?
We knew them both.
Put down three and carry five.
Against what side?
Leave off that.
We had better go in.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Do you remember me?
And how did he make his money?
She is the first person in this house.
You were told.
They left in the morning.
Let me see him, said the young man.
Better late than never.
Let us pass.
Is it true?
Can she sing?
Let this man pass.
Pass this way, then.
Does she go fast?
Leave me out of the question.
Before you leave, tell us.
who told you you could?
You had better come to my house, said the man.
They told me to.
In short, take me.
And what does she want the money for?
Do you know that old lay?
There are four hundred?
This money was for her.
From then on it was war between them.
Well, young man?
About the usual time.
So we came down this road.
Keep in step.
Made me feel so young.
you must step out.
You are right, young man.
Your watch is slow.
Did you tell him your whole story?
It was a round table.
We will talk about that.
But listen to me.
Do you own a dog?
He is very simple.
But how simple it is.
An example would be better.
It was all she could do to hold in.
Why talk to me?
Then get ready at once.
You know me well enough.
Do you remember him?
That may be true.
We were up early.
Remember that time?
Well, are you ready?
And will you direct us?
You may go, said the King.
It will interest you, said he.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Can it be true?
You love him?
Little girl, where have you been?
But she is very young.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
You are cold.
This was true.
But listen to this, he said.
Let us talk about you.
If you know it, that is enough.
Let that pass.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
So the question was, what to do?
No less, no more.
Better write it here.
Listen to this, will you?
Had you heard?
The night was cold and still.
How soon will he be here?
You had better go.
Ask them to sing one more song.
We had a list.
Better cross here.
He knew them.
This is my body.
