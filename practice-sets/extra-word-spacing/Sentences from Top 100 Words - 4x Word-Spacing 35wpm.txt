Can it be?
Who and what are you?
That was all she said.
That will do, he said.
So there it was.
What have you come for?
And what do you call her?
Had to look the other way.
Would you like some?
What is there to see?
and so on, and so on.
But WHAT DID you see?
And do you like him?
What is it all about?
Do you see him?
Or so they said.
Did you know him?
What is that?
How is she?
Is that it?
And what do you make of it?
We have him.
What DO you know of him?
Has it come to this?
But so it is.
And do you like her?
It was from you.
Is it like him?
But what will you do?
At what time?
Did you see her?
Can you do that?
Do as you will.
How was that?
But when will that be?
What could it be?
And what was it for?
Do you see it?
And when will you call?
Is he there?
When is it?
But how is that?
And has it come to this?
are you there?
That is what she did.
And how did you find out?
How did you come by it?
Look at it.
Then make it up.
So that was the way.
You know how it is with her.
Then there is more to do.
What do you make of it?
What are we to do?
So it was.
Now is your time.
There you are.
But what have they been up to?
Who will go first?
Tqhen you may go.
Look at them.
But who was she?
Who was that?
Then what are you up to now?
but there was more to it than this.
He said no.
What did he do to you?
What is he like?
Who are you?
Do you know?
And what did you do then?
Which is it?
Do they know him?
How do you do?
How long has he been there?
Will that do?
What was he like?
Will you come and see her?
What do you see?
And could she see him?
But he had to have it.
Now you know.
Then, how do you know?
And all for what?
Did you know her?
Is that all?
That was it.
What did you do then?
But how about you?
There they are.
Is that her?
We have no water.
No was there one?
What is all this?
What is it about?
What would she have said?
But he had no time.
Is it time?
So be it.
Then what is it?
who can it be?
but what if it is?
Do you know him?
Would you do what he did?
How did he do it?
And is that all?
Are you there?
Do you know what it is?
Who is she?
Now there is no more to be said.
what has she to do with it?
May we come in?
How is he now?
Do as you like.
what is it?
Do you know her?
There is but one thing to do.
And what is that?
You can go.
What other way is there to look at it?
How did you know about it?
There he is, do you see him?
Did you know them?
But what is it?
You know more than we do.
What can we do, then?
The time had come.
You may go.
But what are you up to?
There he is, you see.
but we can go and see.
Did you see it?
One or two?
Call him in.
And who are you?
But it has been so long.
Do you like him?
She has it.
That is a long time.
Then who are you?
And who was that?
Now what are we to do with you?
How is he?
Out of the way.
Then how many are there?
How can it be?
Go on, he said.
Look at him.
That will do, said he.
You can have some.
They said no more.
How are you?
When was it?
What are you up to?
What was it about?
who, then, are you?
The time will come.
What time is it?
You have it.
Who was he?
No one will come, she said.
How would you like to have it?
There he is, she said.
Look at it this way.
What do they call you?
What will you do, then?
What do you make of that?
Do you know what you look like?
And what did you see?
Is it over?
So it is.
Come this way.
There you are, he said.
And who is this?
You can do it.
How did she do it?
How can you know?
What is it like?
When was that?
What can this be?
What is it for?
Look over it.
Is she like him?
You have them?
But will he see it?
Can one see from there?
At what number?
But it was of no use.
What was it?
There were two of them.
What did they do?
How did he do it?
but what if it is?
who can it be?
You can have some.
Do you see it?
It was from you.
and so on, and so on.
But it was of no use.
And how did you find out?
Who and what are you?
Call him in.
You can go.
Do you know what you look like?
How are you?
What will you do, then?
What do you see?
No was there one?
What did he do to you?
You know how it is with her.
When was that?
Do as you like.
Go on, he said.
What do you make of that?
Look at it this way.
Out of the way.
How did you come by it?
There is but one thing to do.
So it was.
You have them?
Now there is no more to be said.
You know more than we do.
What is it for?
That will do, he said.
And what was it for?
Would you do what he did?
But what are you up to?
What is that?
But how is that?
He said no.
Then make it up.
Will you come and see her?
So that was the way.
But who was she?
You may go.
Who was he?
Is it like him?
And what did you see?
There were two of them.
But when will that be?
So be it.
But what have they been up to?

So there it was.
How can you know?
Do they know him?
And is that all?
who, then, are you?
How do you do?
but we can go and see.
Do as you will.
Did you know him?
but there was more to it than this.
Has it come to this?
Do you know?
How was that?
And who is this?
The time will come.
We have no water.
What is there to see?
How is he now?
Who was that?
What is it like?
Do you know him?
Then what is it?
Now is your time.
What was he like?
Do you know what it is?
And who was that?
Who is she?
Did you know her?
How is he?

You have it.
They said no more.

What other way is there to look at it?
