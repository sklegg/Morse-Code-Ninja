Let me see him at once.
Watch him, he said.
What is your real name?
What a night it has been.
Write an answer.
You found him?
To the left.
Is it far?
Let them have it.
It is from your father.
Let me have a word with you.
Why is he cross with me?
It is well thought of.
It was the last day of the year.
Are you my friend?
He may come close.
Is my father here?
You have a car?
Who was the letter from?
They dont know their own country.
How did it begin?
It was very hard.
We never thought of that.
He came at once.
She is still here?
She might be at his house.
No, that can never be.
Let us go back.
Let me go back.
They never come back.
One of us will be here all night.
We should ask him.
It is so very kind of you both.
Call the next one.
Come let us see them.
But are you sure of that?
And she left the room.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
We must go at once.
No, dont.
Now or never.
Well, run back to her.
They are hard at it.
Only, dont look back.
What was it that you thought?
When did you begin?
Dont you see that?
We dont see it like that.
Why, dont you hear it?
See him grow up.
What country does he come from?
But let us walk.
So take care of me.
Where have you been this long while?
They came over last night.
You saw him?
It is open?
It was white.
Do you want some more to eat?
But you got to play music for them.
He is my friend.
Now let me have it.
By and by he got it.
He is at sea.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Tell us a story.
First turn to the left.
It is always so.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
And then they began to fish.
What a start that was.
Good for the country.
Take care of him.
He then said, It is time to start.
Will you never learn?
So it always was.
In the country?
Here we see the boy at school.
And your children?
Let us start, then.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Let me be and let me live.
Where is the river?
Have you found it?
How much have you got?
Do you have a car?
What was left of him?
And what did you learn from him?
Stop, let me show you the way.
Few had found it.
Is he a real father?
Cut your hand open?
And why should they?
Do you hear that?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
And he left the room.
Dont move, he said.
Let me look.
Go to your father.
Well, what next?
Take care.
Dont say that to me.
No, never.
Open the door.
Here is the paper.
She must have a hard time with him.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Who did you learn that from?
Just a few.
He saw his men draw back.
Dont you think so?
Cut him down.
That is the idea.
That was the first night.
There, do you hear?
They may tell us to open it.
That night we were just in time.
Where has she run off to?
But now it is too late.
But hard to tell.
Keep to the right.
And who is this friend?
Who should it be?
Was you in my room?
Are you sure?
He had two left feet.
And now let us go home.
And what did you do with that letter?
They never did it again.
You should take me there one day.
Come over in the sun.
You will answer for it.
This is what began it all.
We got to let that go.
Do you have the letter?
Both of us.
Dont you want any?
Still, you never know.
Why dont you play?
He might still be up.
Watch over him.
Good night, friend.
Here he is at last.
So, once more, good night.
But why dont you want to take it?
There is only food for one.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Can you hear me?
We were together.
Where is this city?
Is that far?
You might want it.
Which story was it?
We got under way at last.
Keep to the left.
What should he say?
But watch over him.
Let me go to the door.
Can you stand?
You must eat now.
There were few near me.
Come, let us be men.
And then we may begin.
Why should they?
Let us go in.
Do you often come back?
We should look at this.
Let me see it.
These were the first people we saw.
Tell her to begin.
what river is it?
He had only one night more to live.
Always the same, year after year.
Say good night.
They always know.
How could you let him go so far?
But it would be in the paper.
We may be too late.
She saw no one?
This is real.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Life is all right.
Let us cross over.
One was on a white horse.
It was like new life to him.
There was no answer.
Any book will tell you that.
But you must never tell.
It must be in her own house.
Well, read the letter again.
Look at his face.
Let him grow up with you.
Let him follow me.
What is life to you?
What did he say in the letter?
Do we stop here?
And this food?
There was no letter for me.
Let me see her.
She came over last night.
Let me get on with my work.
Just cut it out.
It is a long story.
Never see him again.
Have you got that?
Music is a good thing.
He said at last.
Come here, my friend.
Have you been at sea?
And now, good night.
Let me hear your story.
We might learn a thing or two.
But then you would be close to the sea?
You are sure of that?
She saw it.
We are very far from that.
What did he answer?
We got one and they got one.
Who could have thought it?
Let me get to work.
Just set still and take it like a man.
You took it.
A second man got up and went out.
Stop, said he.
You got me?
If you know, why dont you tell?
Do you know where he is?
It was then time to start.
Let me hear what it is.
One never has too much.
Let him answer us.
How many children?
You must study.
Let me in.
For once you are right.
Then let me have a word with you.
He could run no more.
Who said four?
The sun had set long since.
Good night again.
This took him some time.
Point it at his horse.
But take care.
Do you hear me?
Give me the letter.
Which end is his head?
My father is right.
The other night she left.
How many are left?
No, stop.
Do you know how he made his mark?
Who took him out of it?
Have you got it?
At this time of my life, no.
Here is the letter.
How would they stop it?
Always the same with you people.
Who found them out?
You must never tell.
Did you see his eye?
Why, is it late?
Ask one of those men.
It would seem so.
Think of my father.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Let me know at once when you will start.
How could you begin?
You must walk.
Then, good night.
Stop and think.
They dont care.
Are we too late?
At four, she said.
Dont you like it?
What do you hear?
Off with his head.
Tell me more.
No, why should he?
Does he never go out?
What did you hear?
What do you think when you hear music?
No, said her father.
Why, it was one of his own men.
There are only four of us.
Are you sure of it?
She is my friend.
Have you never been there?
Off with her head.
Let me see him.
What was the name of the man who took it?
Let her go.
So they got out and went in.
Is it in the city?
But it is the same with any life.
What do you think of the music?
You are right, father.
Do you want to cross?
She came in just now by the back door.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Do you know what he did last night?
It will be too late.
What would you have me do with my life?
It was his own room.
Is there any answer?
At last we have a man.
We found it.
We are together.
But she saw no one?
Come eat with me.
Dont tell me.
It is music.
Who can answer for that?
You are sure of it?
Are we late?
No, said the Tree.
He has been been found.
Let me out.
She got up.
Keep watch all night.
He is my father.
Come at once.
But then it will be too late.
So he began to help.
Sure of what?
She never came back.
Let me say one thing.
it took all that time to come over the water.
Here is the book.
Just cut it out, will you?
But what did you hear?
Who let you in?
He has children of his own.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
But it is all all too late now.
The children will live just the same.
But it was very late.
Why dont you want to go?
Where could you keep it?
Right here it began.
He is always at it.
Our own people must come first.
But they may still come here.
A call for help, you thought?
This is my country.
Now you must eat.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Why do you stop here?
Why should this be so?
They are always the same.
There to the left.
We must begin again.
It might help.
And there are four of you?
