Which story was it?
Let me out.
No, that can never be.
It would seem so.
Why dont you play?
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
We should look at this.
Cut your hand open?
That is the idea.
He said at last.
Was you in my room?
Dont say that to me.
We were together.
Let me know at once when you will start.
You will answer for it.
There, do you hear?
Tell us a story.
Still, you never know.
No, never.
Stop, said he.
He has been been found.
Is my father here?
No, said the Tree.
You must never tell.
These were the first people we saw.
It was then time to start.
This is what began it all.
Music is a good thing.
Is it far?
There were few near me.
We never thought of that.
Let me have a word with you.
Well, what next?
She is my friend.
Stop and think.
In the country?
Why, is it late?
We got under way at last.
Our own people must come first.
We might learn a thing or two.
What country does he come from?
Is there any answer?
So take care of me.
Here is the paper.
Watch over him.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Do you hear me?
Sure of what?
Here he is at last.
What do you think of the music?
Is he a real father?
We got to let that go.
And your children?
So they got out and went in.
Take care of him.
We found it.
They always know.
But you must never tell.
Good for the country.
Off with her head.
Then, good night.
Dont you think so?
Keep to the right.
The children will live just the same.
Who did you learn that from?
Are you sure of it?
Keep to the left.
It was very hard.
Have you got that?
But it is the same with any life.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Do you want some more to eat?
Just cut it out.
Here is the letter.
She came over last night.
What was left of him?
He may come close.
Let me look.
Write an answer.
He had two left feet.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Why, dont you hear it?
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
We dont see it like that.
When did you begin?
Now let me have it.
Are you my friend?
Why should they?
Never see him again.
Let us cross over.
Have you been at sea?
And now let us go home.
Where is this city?
A second man got up and went out.
Let me in.
And then they began to fish.
This took him some time.
Let me say one thing.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Do you know what he did last night?
Both of us.
Stop, let me show you the way.
It is from your father.
Let us go in.
What is your real name?
And then we may begin.
You took it.
Let me go back.
Is that far?
There is only food for one.
We are very far from that.
It was like new life to him.
But let us walk.
Let her go.
They dont know their own country.
But she saw no one?
Say good night.
They are hard at it.
And what did you do with that letter?
You are sure of it?
Go to your father.
She must have a hard time with him.
Take care.
What was the name of the man who took it?
They never come back.
Any book will tell you that.
Let me hear your story.
And she left the room.
Let me hear what it is.
It is a long story.
We got one and they got one.
Let me get to work.
Who found them out?
Where could you keep it?
Who can answer for that?
He might still be up.
It is always so.
Tell her to begin.
Are we too late?
And this food?
Here we see the boy at school.
Dont you like it?
But are you sure of that?
But it would be in the paper.
Where is the river?
Come over in the sun.
There are only four of us.
You have a car?
By and by he got it.
Well, run back to her.
How many children?
What do you think when you hear music?
He is always at it.
He is my father.
Now or never.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Good night, friend.
But you got to play music for them.
Where has she run off to?
He came at once.
Point it at his horse.
At last we have a man.
Let him follow me.
Who let you in?
This took place at his house, in his room.
But now it is too late.
They are always the same.
Ask one of those men.
It will be too late.
What would you have me do with my life?
Come let us see them.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
They dont care.
What did he say in the letter?
Look at his face.
You saw him?
Did you see his eye?
That night we were just in time.
Let me see him at once.
Who took him out of it?
What did you hear?
it took all that time to come over the water.
No, why should he?
You might want it.
At this time of my life, no.
Come at once.
But what did you hear?
Which end is his head?
They never did it again.
Always the same, year after year.
Have you found it?
Off with his head.
Come eat with me.
Do you often come back?
How many are left?
Give me the letter.
We must begin again.
It was the last day of the year.
Have you never been there?
No, said her father.
For once you are right.
She got up.
There was no answer.
And what did you learn from him?
Let him grow up with you.
She is still here?
He had only one night more to live.
We may be too late.
Let me go to the door.
Watch him, he said.
It was white.
Who should it be?
So, once more, good night.
How did it begin?
He saw his men draw back.
No, dont.
Always the same with you people.
It is so very kind of you both.
To the left.
It is open?
Why should this be so?
Come here, my friend.
Call the next one.
That was the first night.
Cut him down.
Let me see him.
Is it in the city?
At four, she said.
Do we stop here?
Who was the letter from?
Do you have a car?
Only, dont look back.
Have you got it?
It was the first thing he thought of.
Now you must eat.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
And now, good night.
Why, it was one of his own men.
But it was very late.
But they may still come here.
No, stop.
He is my friend.
How much have you got?
Keep watch all night.
What should he say?
Do you know where he is?
How would they stop it?
How could you begin?
Who could have thought it?
Dont tell me.
Here is the book.
Life is all right.
It must be in her own house.
We must go at once.
Why dont you want to go?
What do you hear?
Are we late?
He is at sea.
What did he answer?
Well, let us be sure of that.
Then let me have a word with you.
She might be at his house.
And there are four of you?
Come, let us be men.
They came over last night.
What a night it has been.
Dont move, he said.
They may tell us to open it.
She came in just now by the back door.
It might help.
Do you want to cross?
You got me?
But then it will be too late.
Do you know how he made his mark?
You must eat now.
Good night again.
What a start that was.
She never came back.
My father is right.
But then you would be close to the sea?
But take care.
Let us start, then.
But it is all all too late now.
Let me get on with my work.
Let me see her.
It is music.
She saw no one?
Right here it began.
You are sure of that?
You must walk.
Let us go back.
You are right, father.
So he began to help.
She saw it.
He has children of his own.
But why dont you want to take it?
Why do you stop here?
He then said, It is time to start.
And why should they?
Does he never go out?
You know all the men from this part of the country.
There was no letter for me.
You found him?
Few had found it.
Dont you see that?
Why is he cross with me?
How could you let him go so far?
Let them have it.
Where have you been this long while?
Just a few.
This is my country.
There to the left.
What was it that you thought?
Can you hear me?
So it always was.
First turn to the left.
You should take me there one day.
One of us will be here all night.
And he left the room.
Tell me more.
The sun had set long since.
Let me see it.
Well, read the letter again.
Let me be and let me live.
Will you never learn?
Do you have the letter?
But hard to tell.
Dont you want any?
This is real.
We are together.
We should ask him.
Let him answer us.
It is well thought of.
It was his own room.
Open the door.
One never has too much.
Do you hear that?
Think of my father.
Who said four?
What is life to you?
Are you sure?
A call for help, you thought?
He could run no more.
See him grow up.
You must study.
The other night she left.
Can you stand?
what river is it?
One was on a white horse.
But watch over him.
And who is this friend?
Just cut it out, will you?
