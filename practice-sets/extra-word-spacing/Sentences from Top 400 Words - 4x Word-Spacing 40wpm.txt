They knew it.
But what did we ever get for it?
What a state he was in.
Where did they get the money from?
Take a hold of it.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Is it true?
Hold her hand.
He got it this morning.
No, my love.
Ten, did you say?
What kind of a bird?
That is enough for me.
Are we ready?
Do you want any money?
And you can sing?
Five young children.
Is your man white or black?
It would be better if you went to the war.
We must make the best of it.
You were told.
You are a good girl.
Every word you said was heard.
No less, no more.
This money was for her.
It would have been more simple.
That was the question.
And what does she want the money for?
She must be told.
That is very simple.
He never told us what it was she said.
Look to the west.
We are ready.
What a question.
On fire, on fire.
The world is big enough.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Which king?
Read them, said the King.
How soon will he be here?
He has money.
Do you own a dog?
Much of it was true.
That must be true.
They told me to.
You are better than that.
It is the rule.
As soon as you left, it began.
He put his hand over part of the map.
Pull together.
I have no children to love me.
If you only knew.
He will leave me.
You saw the person?
One other question, said he.
And serve them right.
Why do we love?
He said, get him out of the road.
About the usual time.
Are you still cold?
What will happen to us?
How could that happen?
Your watch is slow.
Remember that time?
Are you in love with her?
And dont talk to me.
So the question was, what to do?
We serve them.
You had better go.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
what could be better?
Let us pass.
Why do you serve?
Now, listen.
And you are still so young.
Did he though?
She is very plain.
You remember the place, my father?
It is a rock.
That is true.
Half as many is too much.
A better man than you.
The family was at home.
They all heard me.
You must leave that to me.
It was cold.
you should know her better than me.
So we came down this road.
They are still young.
It has been there ever since.
She had very little notice from him.
In short, take me.
Did you tell him your whole story?
You may leave the room.
Well, are you ready?
But listen to me.
He is very simple.
Was he young or old?
We had better go in.
How did this happen?
It was true to life.
The King Went to him.
A house is on fire?
It was a round table.
But listen to this, he said.
You are right, young man.
It is cold.
Are you here on leave?
Against what side?
The rock was very small.
What does he feel?
What will happen now?
Well, said the girl, let us go.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
They left in the morning.
Do you love her much?
Now listen to me.
In an hour?
Answer me this one question.
And so they knew that it was true.
She told me all about it.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
It was all she could do to hold in.
Are you ready to play?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Half a mile?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
But why must you leave me so soon?
When did this happen?
We were up early.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
But how simple it is.
Had you heard?
Have you told her?
Let me remember what he said.
Why did it happen?
You love him?
Does he love you?
Let this man pass.
Where are you off to so early?
But let that pass.
He said, the work is now complete.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
What size do you want?
Then get ready at once.
How do you feel?
We call it black.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
And how did he make his money?
Keep in step.
Little girl, where have you been?
Fire and water, earth and air.
You must travel.
You are right, my love.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
But enough of this.
How far from the body?
Let us leave them, she said.
Are you all ready?
We dont know enough.
And will you direct us?
She is the first person in this house.
But he never heard me.
Leave me out of the question.
You will soon know.
Is that true?
Are you ready?
You can pass through the door.
And then he told all he knew.
An example would be better.
And that is the whole point.
Leave off that.
There are four hundred?
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Let that pass.
That was the rule, she said.
You know me well enough.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
They had several children.
What is there to talk about?
Who told you so?
Better write it here.
It is a young girl.
But she is very young.
She is fast?
Have you a family?
That may be true.
When do you leave?
Have you heard?
Light my fire.
They can have all our half of the house.
Are you better?
Do you remember him?
Made me feel so young.
Before you leave, tell us.
Take good care of the little girl.
Will you answer that question?
What can happen?
You are in love with me?
Did they ever go back?
And so they began to talk.
Can you sing?
Let us talk a little about my father.
Leave any for him?
Let us talk about you.
Did you get any money?
Let me hear from you soon.
And you will always love him?
It is true.
Listen to me.
you know better than that.
A young man?
If you know it, that is enough.
So do you, my love.
We knew them both.
He never heard.
You may go, said the King.
Young man, you will go far.
This will pass in no time.
It can never happen.
Let me see him, said the young man.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Put down three and carry five.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
No, he is a man about my size.
She was so young, too.
He is better than any of you.
They had heard all that before.
To know her is to love her.
you must step out.
And why do you serve?
Do you love me?
Can it be true?
It is a fire.
Well, young man?
What have you heard?
How do you feel now?
Never heard of it.
How short his time.
Feel better then.
An hour and a half.
Then you will know me better.
Who was it told me his name?
She knew at once.
Does she go fast?
They had much to talk about.
He knew them.
How does it feel?
What do you mean by that question?
Long live the king.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Do you remember me?
She knew what was good for children.
Do you know that old lay?
In an hour it will be at the door.
She was a good girl.
Why talk to me?
That would be the best way.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
It was true.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
From then on it was war between them.
Take notice.
Pull it more to your side.
Never heard of it before.
Listen to him.
Who told you that?
Can she sing?
The night was cold.
We had a list.
The dog is always with him.
She was only a little girl.
Listen to them, he said.
Do you remember?
Ask them to sing one more song.
Hold it up to the light.
She told me to ask you.
Let me also ask you a question.
Had they been heard?
There was no wind.
Better cross here.
Listen to this, will you?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Long and the short of it.
You have an hour.
Are they made to order?
who told you you could?
Have you heard from him often?
What have you against me now?
This is my body.
Try it on the dog first.
Pass this way, then.
How does this happen?
You are on a ship?
Then what would happen?
He had my love.
Never heard of him.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
The night was cold and still.
We got her half way.
He had enough of it.
But one day you must feel it.
She is much better.
Has she any family?
Is your family well?
We will talk about that.
You are cold.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Where he was, no one knew.
That is enough.
Better late than never.
Ten will be early enough.
It will interest you, said he.
Your true father?
This is simple.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
How many children did he leave?
This was true.
No more money?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Is the wind north or south?
What is love?
Why do they want to make her sing?
You will always love him?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
