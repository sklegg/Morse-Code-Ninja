Let him follow me.
And then we may begin.
We never thought of that.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
This took place at his house, in his room.
Cut him down.
They are hard at it.
See him grow up.
Tell her to begin.
Are you sure?
Let them have it.
The sun had set long since.
Let me see him.
Where is the river?
Let her go.
Let me get to work.
That is the idea.
Now you must eat.
He is my friend.
You must eat now.
Where could you keep it?
What would you have me do with my life?
There was no letter for me.
Do you hear me?
Dont you see that?
What do you think when you hear music?
Well, what next?
She is still here?
For once you are right.
That night we were just in time.
It might help.
It was the first thing he thought of.
Now let me have it.
But she saw no one?
He is at sea.
Come over in the sun.
What is your real name?
But hard to tell.
He could run no more.
Will you never learn?
One never has too much.
One of us will be here all night.
But it is all all too late now.
Where have you been this long while?
Let me in.
Is he a real father?
We must go at once.
Take care of him.
But they may still come here.
Have you been at sea?
It is well thought of.
Let me go back.
How could you let him go so far?
They never come back.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Who let you in?
We must begin again.
Dont you think so?
Just cut it out.
Why, it was one of his own men.
But it would be in the paper.
This took him some time.
What a night it has been.
Let me be and let me live.
So take care of me.
Let me see him at once.
You took it.
We were together.
Come at once.
Which story was it?
Are you my friend?
Cut your hand open?
Well, read the letter again.
But then you would be close to the sea?
What is life to you?
A call for help, you thought?
There is only food for one.
And who is this friend?
Well, let us be sure of that.
What did you hear?
When did you begin?
Why dont you want to go?
Here he is at last.
Dont say that to me.
Stop, let me show you the way.
You must study.
Just a few.
Who found them out?
It is open?
You got me?
Who said four?
Let me hear your story.
Why dont you play?
Here is the book.
Do you know how he made his mark?
Music is a good thing.
The other night she left.
You are sure of that?
It is a long story.
She came over last night.
Did you see his eye?
There were few near me.
Our own people must come first.
Tell me more.
Are you sure of it?
She might be at his house.
We found it.
And what did you learn from him?
He has children of his own.
No, said the Tree.
She never came back.
Are we late?
Have you never been there?
Let me know at once when you will start.
Good night, friend.
He said at last.
Here we see the boy at school.
Do you hear that?
They dont know their own country.
Let me hear what it is.
Off with his head.
Let us go back.
That was the first night.
But now it is too late.
But why dont you want to take it?
Open the door.
He had only one night more to live.
He may come close.
How would they stop it?
So he began to help.
You must never tell.
They never did it again.
What do you hear?
what river is it?
Why should they?
But what did you hear?
Is it in the city?
Write an answer.
At this time of my life, no.
There are only four of us.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Have you got that?
We got one and they got one.
There was no answer.
Never see him again.
Can you hear me?
He might still be up.
And what did you do with that letter?
Where has she run off to?
Keep watch all night.
This is what began it all.
Off with her head.
These were the first people we saw.
No, never.
She saw no one?
It is so very kind of you both.
Let us go in.
How could you begin?
In the country?
Why, dont you hear it?
Do you have a car?
She is my friend.
No, dont.
No, that can never be.
Tell us a story.
One was on a white horse.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
You found him?
What should he say?
Well, run back to her.
Only, dont look back.
What did he say in the letter?
Come eat with me.
Any book will tell you that.
Then let me have a word with you.
How many are left?
Come here, my friend.
There to the left.
But you must never tell.
Do you want some more to eat?
What was the name of the man who took it?
What was left of him?
You are right, father.
Let me go to the door.
My father is right.
They are always the same.
We got under way at last.
Can you stand?
Is that far?
What country does he come from?
But watch over him.
This is my country.
Stop, said he.
Does he never go out?
It was the last day of the year.
It was like new life to him.
Let me get on with my work.
No, said her father.
Think of my father.
How many children?
It was white.
Is my father here?
Here is the paper.
First turn to the left.
Who took him out of it?
And she left the room.
A second man got up and went out.
But you got to play music for them.
Let him grow up with you.
So, once more, good night.
Good for the country.
Let him answer us.
They dont care.
And there are four of you?
We may be too late.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
And this food?
Let me say one thing.
Do you want to cross?
How much have you got?
And why should they?
It must be in her own house.
Dont move, he said.
It will be too late.
It was his own room.
We are very far from that.
We should ask him.
You will answer for it.
Sure of what?
It is from your father.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
It is music.
Why should this be so?
Why is he cross with me?
She saw it.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
He has been been found.
Right here it began.
Let me see it.
Which end is his head?
At last we have a man.
He came at once.
It was then time to start.
Now or never.
Who should it be?
Look at his face.
But it is the same with any life.
We are together.
It would seem so.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Do you know what he did last night?
They always know.
And your children?
It was very hard.
And then they began to fish.
He is my father.
Just cut it out, will you?
Is it far?
So they got out and went in.
How did it begin?
By and by he got it.
You should take me there one day.
Let me out.
Good night again.
Both of us.
Was you in my room?
We got to let that go.
Why, is it late?
To the left.
She must have a hard time with him.
They may tell us to open it.
Dont tell me.
Dont you like it?
Who was the letter from?
We might learn a thing or two.
We dont see it like that.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Go to your father.
Who could have thought it?
No, stop.
No, why should he?
Do we stop here?
it took all that time to come over the water.
Who did you learn that from?
Do you have the letter?
Always the same, year after year.
But it was very late.
But let us walk.
Keep to the left.
Few had found it.
Say good night.
Watch over him.
Stop and think.
What did he answer?
Always the same with you people.
Let us start, then.
Then, good night.
Let me have a word with you.
She got up.
Do you often come back?
You must walk.
There, do you hear?
Let me see her.
He saw his men draw back.
At four, she said.
And he left the room.
Why do you stop here?
What was it that you thought?
Let us cross over.
But take care.
Take care.
Watch him, he said.
What a start that was.
It is always so.
We should look at this.
But then it will be too late.
Give me the letter.
Are we too late?
Dont you want any?
He is always at it.
Have you got it?
He then said, It is time to start.
Here is the letter.
Where is this city?
Point it at his horse.
She came in just now by the back door.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
Let me look.
Call the next one.
Keep to the right.
And now let us go home.
This is real.
Who can answer for that?
The children will live just the same.
Have you found it?
Ask one of those men.
Life is all right.
But are you sure of that?
Come let us see them.
You saw him?
Is there any answer?
You have a car?
He had two left feet.
Come, let us be men.
What do you think of the music?
Do you know where he is?
You are sure of it?
So it always was.
And now, good night.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
They came over last night.
You might want it.
Still, you never know.
