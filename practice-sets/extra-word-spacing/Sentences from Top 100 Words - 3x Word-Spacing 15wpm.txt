How is he now?
Do you like him?
Do they know him?
Tqhen you may go.
But what will you do?
Now is your time.
Is he there?
And could she see him?
That is a long time.
Look over it.
What could it be?
We have him.
So it was.
How is he?
Did you see it?
Do you know what it is?
There he is, do you see him?
But will he see it?
Now there is no more to be said.
Are you there?
But he had no time.
How is she?
What did you do then?
What is it like?
What would she have said?
Did you know them?
Is she like him?
The time had come.
You can do it.
What are we to do?
How was that?
are you there?
What is it all about?
Now what are we to do with you?
And do you like her?
Do you know?
What can this be?
But when will that be?
When was it?
Then make it up.
And what was it for?
Do you see him?
No was there one?
What DO you know of him?
What time is it?
And when will you call?
How do you do?
No one will come, she said.
Would you like some?
Do you know her?
Do as you like.
Is that it?
How can it be?
Then how many are there?
Who was that?
At what time?
What was it?
There were two of them.
But it has been so long.
They said no more.
And who is this?
The time will come.
who can it be?
Has it come to this?
What did he do to you?
Who and what are you?
You know more than we do.
There they are.
It was from you.
But what are you up to?
Is it over?
How did you know about it?
And what is that?
Do you see it?
You know how it is with her.
Do you know him?
Do you know what you look like?
And all for what?
And what did you see?
Go on, he said.
Can one see from there?
There you are, he said.
Did you know her?
what has she to do with it?
Out of the way.
We have no water.
But so it is.
Is it time?
Look at it this way.
But who was she?
Who is she?
Is that all?
And is that all?
What have you come for?
What will you do, then?
What can we do, then?
What was he like?
How did you come by it?
So there it was.
but what if it is?
And what do you call her?
What do you see?
You can go.
He said no.
There you are.
What do you make of it?
and so on, and so on.
who, then, are you?
Will that do?
You may go.
When is it?
What are you up to?
What was it about?
How are you?
You have it.
And who was that?
But what have they been up to?
One or two?
So that was the way.
Come this way.
And do you like him?
May we come in?
Then what are you up to now?
What did they do?
But WHAT DID you see?
But how about you?
There he is, you see.
So it is.
How long has he been there?
And what do you make of it?
But it was of no use.
Do as you will.
Which is it?
What is it about?
what is it?
Did you see her?
At what number?
How can you know?
She has it.
Is that her?
Would you do what he did?
So be it.
Or so they said.
Can it be?
What other way is there to look at it?
How did he do it?
Now you know.
Who was he?
And has it come to this?
That will do, he said.
You have them?
There is but one thing to do.
How would you like to have it?
Who will go first?
What is that?
And what did you do then?
What is all this?
What is there to see?
That is what she did.
Who are you?
But what is it?
You can have some.
but there was more to it than this.
When was that?
And who are you?
Look at them.
Call him in.
How did she do it?
Did you know him?
But how is that?
Look at it.
That was it.
And how did you find out?
That will do, said he.
Then what is it?
Look at him.
Will you come and see her?
What is he like?
Had to look the other way.
What do you make of that?
Then there is more to do.
What is it for?
Then, how do you know?
Is it like him?
There he is, she said.
But he had to have it.
Then who are you?
Can you do that?
but we can go and see.
That was all she said.
What do they call you?
How can you know?
Is that all?
The time will come.
There is but one thing to do.
She has it.
but there was more to it than this.
But what will you do?
Do you know what it is?
And when will you call?
What did they do?
Do you like him?
And has it come to this?
How did she do it?
What can this be?
And what did you see?
How would you like to have it?
We have no water.
You can do it.
Would you do what he did?
Do you know?
Did you know him?
What will you do, then?
Then make it up.
How do you do?
What is it all about?
Had to look the other way.
What have you come for?
There he is, she said.
So that was the way.
Then how many are there?
But what is it?
So be it.
Do as you like.
And is that all?
Who will go first?
Who was that?
But when will that be?
Look at it this way.
What DO you know of him?
Is he there?
Then, how do you know?
How did you know about it?
You may go.
Is she like him?
But he had no time.
But will he see it?
He said no.
What are you up to?
There you are, he said.
Is that her?
So it was.
Out of the way.
Is it like him?
How are you?
And all for what?
What did you do then?
but we can go and see.
We have him.
May we come in?
Do you know what you look like?
You have it.
But how is that?
Now you know.
There he is, do you see him?
What do you make of it?
But he had to have it.
Did you know them?
No one will come, she said.
What did he do to you?
You have them?
The time had come.
What do you make of that?
One or two?
And who are you?
What is all this?
what has she to do with it?
What would she have said?
Which is it?
Who is she?
But so it is.
Now is your time.
Look at them.
Look at him.
Is it over?
Now what are we to do with you?
But WHAT DID you see?
Tqhen you may go.
How can it be?
Look over it.
Now there is no more to be said.
Did you see her?
But who was she?

And what is that?
That is what she did.
Who and what are you?
Come this way.
So there it was.
And do you like him?
There he is, you see.
Is that it?
It was from you.
You know more than we do.
But it has been so long.
Who are you?
Has it come to this?
How long has he been there?
