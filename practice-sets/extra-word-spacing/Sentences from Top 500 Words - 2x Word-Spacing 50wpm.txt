She began to cry.
Nothing new under the sun.
What did the letter contain?
It was brought to me.
Yes, she could sing that.
You must stay.
You brought no one with you?
It is very clear.
Which box do you mean?
The snow is deep.
Wait a second.
Yes, she said.
Yes and no.
Never mind that.
In that town there is a street.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Yes, there it is.
Let us sit down.
Did it all rest on me?
What age is he?
Oh, just listen.
You could see there was a story behind it.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
Are you strong?
The little boy lay in his bed.
The night was very dark.
And what have you done to me?
Behind my bed.
You can sleep here.
There is no one in that room behind you.
It was done.
Oh, do you know?
Then all was dark again.
It was a cold, dark night.
Money is no object?
Perhaps you would like to read it.
I hear his voice in the house.
Well, of course.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
Will you rest here a little?
The whole night the tree stood still.
That was well done.
What kind of voice is it?
Why, of course.
What is done is done.
They need a rest.
There is your old bed.
Leave the rest to me.
The city was soon behind me.
Yes, but what did she say?
Wait and see.
This voice was that of my father.
It is time for bed.
Oh, to be sure.
In her name, then, let it be done.
It was a record run.
And sit in the dark?
But how long ago?
At his side was a large green box.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
Get to bed.
It was a dark night.
is it come yet?
Fine, very fine.
Sit down, said the old man.
Oh, all right.
Then he must be a wonder.
What is power?
Never mind me.
Is he in bed?
You knew it, and said nothing?
There was more to be done.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
You are in my power.
Oh let me in.
Of course it is.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Oh, do the best you can.
Yes, very well.
Oh, go on.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
She gave me her hand.
Her voice was low.
How was that possible?
They all fall to the ground.
All that for nothing?
Did she stay long?
You love a certain person.
Again came the voice.
Yes, said the old man.
Oh, take me with you.
You better stay here all night.
You must have a rest.
He must be in the same boat as us.
You will fall.
And here is the note.
No, nothing of the kind.
What has brought you here?
Yes, you are right.
Well, what does that lead up to?
There, by the wheel.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Why did you bring him here?
See what you have done.
Are they on foot?
Is it certain?
His plan is very simple.
He had, to be sure, done much.
A fine thing too.
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
Decide if you are going back home.
Come quick.
It is a real bed.
And what a voice she has.
He knew nothing.
Well, there he stood.
Oh, take those off.
Oh, he is so kind.
Do you see that island?
His first cry was for his father.
Oh, dont ask me.
Clear my name.
My mind is made up.
He must wait.
If only they would be quick.
Yes, she was back.
Why should my father fly?
Help me sit up.
Just let us go free.
You are free to do so.
There is no possible way.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Oh, man.
There is a lot of people.
It is done.
It has to be done.
Yes, sit down.
He began to laugh.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Take good note of it.
Yes, all right.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Then lead the way.
Well, sit down by me.
What can be done?
Oh, that.
And then the game began all over again.
This is a test.
It is no use, said a voice.
He had made up his mind.
What has he done?
The night is so long, and yet so short.
Half the town was there.
Oh, no.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
and so he decide he go back home.
Oh, you are there.
And he told you nothing?
Nothing is more simple.
It was cold and dark.
Yes, that was a picture book.
You must stay with me.
Never mind how he came here.
Can it be possible?
His will be done.
But she is nothing to me now.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Bring them here.
Did he fall?
Very well, wait a minute.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Yes, he did.
Lead me to him.
Your voice is that of a young man.
Now we must wait.
They call him a fine boy.
The water ran dry.
Of course they will.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
Who gave it to you?
Go in there and drive them out.
Wonder is it like that.
It was a very dark night.
They know nothing about it.
What brought you here?
Yes, go and find out.
Fly, my friend.
Stay where you are.
It is certain.
But let us see your plan.
Come, and we can rest together.
Let him go free?
Yes, we know that.
He gave me this paper.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
He was here a minute ago.
It is possible.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
It was very dark.
Money is power.
Where can you wait for me?
But it must be done soon.
But wait a minute.
Quick, friend, quick.
It was a kind of language between us.
He has a good voice still.
It was so long ago.
Oh, this is too much.
That would be a fine thing.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Behind every book is a man.
Yes, it did.
Better sit still.
It might have done me good.
Free to do what?
He brought it with him for us to see.
Wonder what he does.
Yes, that is true.
It was so very long ago.
It is all done.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
She heard and saw nothing.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
Wait a minute.
How was it done?
Wait for me here, all of you.
What a game.
Yes, he said, all of it.
The old man gave no answer.
Oh, but you were there?
Did she fall?
He is in the box.
Oh, of course.
And you can do nothing until then?
Well, but where can he fly to?
But that is nothing to us.
Wait for me.
Oh, nothing.
Nothing had come of it.
Well yes, you are right.
Look at that dark water.
Answer me that, miss.
Well then, be quick.
Of course she will.
Nothing at all.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Oh, that is very simple.
Keep clear of him.
No, nothing at all.
Oh, come now.
He saw nothing.
What more is to be done?
Oh, if men only knew.
We are more strong together.
Of course he was right.
Yes, what is it?
The island was a mile long.
Yes, my love?
Who brought you up?
That is a fact.
We must be quick.
In a minute.
It must be done.
Dont laugh.
It was full of people.
You can hear that, miss?
But what must be done?
Well, miss?
We brought them in.
He stood up.
Yes, go on.
Clear the table.
It was right in front of us.
Why does the boat go so fast?
But what then must be done?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
The night was dark.
He left long ago.
What have they done?
It is his voice.
All of this was possible.
She could think of nothing more to say.
Well, what about my plan?
We are free to act and think.
Like these in shape and size?
The whole day had been hot.
Yes, it is true.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Oh, tell me.
He ran up to them.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
She got her hand free.
It must be done at once.
But they could see nothing.
And yet you are the better off?
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Wonder if he has a name.
He will sleep an hour.
He is among us.
Laugh, if you will.
Yes, and no.
Clear the way.
Nothing could have been better.
Let her wait.
It is nothing.
There is nothing more to be said.
That is possible.
Do you have my note?
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
It stood behind the door.
Nothing she can eat?
Let me see your plan.
Then it is certain?
Yes, he said.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Oh, do as you like.
Nothing could be more simple.
Is that a fact?
Oh, very well, he said.
Sit down, he said.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Go and rest.
This made him wonder more and more.
How long would you keep me in town?
What have they done with my work?
Just go to sleep.
Here is our plan.
Oh, how can you sleep?
Well, sit down.
Be back in a minute.
Yes, once.
Yes, but only for you and me.
All was dark.
Bring it here.
Bring this with you.
Is it possible?
My mind was soon made up.
Try to sleep.
You know nothing about it.
Yes, to be sure.
Perhaps he did.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
You know you must say yes.
Be quick, for the time is short.
How is that done?
Is that possible?
It was a warm night.
Yes, of course.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
And yet you said he had money.
But never mind that.
What have you done?
Play the game out.
How long ago?
It was hot.
He never said nothing.
Good to rest once in a way.
Is my father in town?
She was still game.
Go back to bed.
All right then, sit down.
Of course it might.
Hold on a minute.
How can a little dog laugh?
They would cry.
