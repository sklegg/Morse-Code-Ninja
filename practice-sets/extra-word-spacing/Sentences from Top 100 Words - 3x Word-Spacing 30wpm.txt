What do you see?
What are we to do?
And do you like her?
Then how many are there?
Do you like him?
How can it be?
It was from you.
who, then, are you?
Is it like him?
Now is your time.
and so on, and so on.
At what number?
Is that all?
Come this way.
Do you know what you look like?
What is that?
What do you make of it?
When is it?
And could she see him?
What is it like?
Is that her?
There you are, he said.
but there was more to it than this.
what is it?
But will he see it?
There he is, she said.
What did he do to you?
Out of the way.
And has it come to this?
Go on, he said.
There is but one thing to do.
You can go.
How is she?
Do you see him?
That is a long time.
Who was he?
Is it over?
And what is that?
But he had to have it.
There you are.
You know more than we do.
Who are you?
That is what she did.
So be it.
And is that all?
One or two?
What can we do, then?
Then, how do you know?
May we come in?
Look over it.
But how is that?
Do you know what it is?
What DO you know of him?
You can have some.
Would you do what he did?
There they are.
Did you see her?
Do as you like.
So it was.
So there it was.
And what do you call her?
Now what are we to do with you?
And what do you make of it?
What did they do?
What is it all about?
How was that?
Do you know her?
You may go.
Which is it?
Who was that?
How are you?
But what are you up to?
what has she to do with it?
And do you like him?
Look at it this way.
Who and what are you?
What was it?
What did you do then?
Do you see it?
And what did you do then?
What is it for?
You know how it is with her.
That will do, he said.
Look at it.
Do they know him?
How do you do?
Call him in.
When was that?
who can it be?
And when will you call?
What time is it?
Now you know.
Did you see it?
How did you come by it?
What do they call you?
And who was that?
How would you like to have it?
How long has he been there?
How did he do it?
Will that do?
Then who are you?
But it has been so long.
The time had come.
How can you know?
Is he there?
But when will that be?
Had to look the other way.
At what time?
And all for what?
There he is, you see.
What could it be?
Are you there?
What is there to see?
What was it about?
And what did you see?
That was it.
Can one see from there?
but what if it is?
What are you up to?
We have him.
Then what is it?
Tqhen you may go.
There he is, do you see him?
Will you come and see her?
And how did you find out?
Who is she?
What do you make of that?
Is she like him?
What other way is there to look at it?
Do as you will.
When was it?
But who was she?
Then make it up.
No one will come, she said.
What will you do, then?
How did she do it?
How is he?
How is he now?
And what was it for?
He said no.
You have it.
but we can go and see.
We have no water.
There were two of them.
What can this be?
Now there is no more to be said.
Can it be?
Who will go first?
How did you know about it?
But so it is.
Would you like some?
What was he like?
Look at him.
Has it come to this?
Did you know them?
But what have they been up to?
Do you know?
You can do it.
Or so they said.
Can you do that?
But he had no time.
But how about you?
Do you know him?
But what is it?
What would she have said?
Then what are you up to now?
She has it.
The time will come.
That will do, said he.
Look at them.
What is it about?
But WHAT DID you see?
are you there?
Is it time?
That was all she said.
Did you know him?
Did you know her?
What is he like?
They said no more.
No was there one?
So it is.
But it was of no use.
What have you come for?
And who are you?
But what will you do?
Then there is more to do.
You have them?
So that was the way.
Is that it?
What is all this?
And who is this?
There they are.
Did you know her?
Come this way.
Do you know what it is?
There you are.
What will you do, then?
But it has been so long.
What was it about?
But it was of no use.
What is it for?
What do they call you?
When was it?
That was all she said.
What DO you know of him?
She has it.
Is it like him?
There he is, do you see him?
Did you see it?
At what number?
Then what are you up to now?
What is it all about?
What is there to see?
What can this be?
Is it over?
And what was it for?
How did he do it?
Would you do what he did?
Who is she?
You can go.
what has she to do with it?
Do you like him?
How do you do?
It was from you.
Do as you like.
but we can go and see.
That will do, he said.
Then, how do you know?
How long has he been there?
The time will come.
The time had come.
are you there?
Do you know?
What do you see?
What is it like?
What would she have said?
We have no water.
They said no more.
Do you know her?
But how is that?
So be it.
Now what are we to do with you?

Is she like him?
How is he now?
You can do it.
And who was that?
Do you see it?
And what do you call her?
Will you come and see her?
What is he like?
Do as you will.
But what have they been up to?
And how did you find out?
That was it.
What have you come for?
So that was the way.
But he had to have it.
Did you know him?
What did he do to you?
How did you come by it?
You know how it is with her.
Will that do?
and so on, and so on.
Who was that?
Now there is no more to be said.
What was it?
And do you like him?
Then what is it?
How can you know?
Is that all?
You may go.
What other way is there to look at it?
Or so they said.
Then how many are there?
And who is this?
No one will come, she said.
But what is it?
We have him.
Which is it?
You have them?

Who and what are you?
Did you know them?
One or two?
Is that it?
Then who are you?
Are you there?

How is she?
Look at it.
Now you know.
Out of the way.
but there was more to it than this.
There were two of them.
Who will go first?
Did you see her?
That will do, said he.
What do you make of that?
You have it.
And what did you see?
And do you like her?
There he is, you see.
And all for what?
Tqhen you may go.
What can we do, then?
Look over it.
But he had no time.
May we come in?

Go on, he said.
So it was.
Then there is more to do.
You know more than we do.
Do you see him?

How was that?
But how about you?
But so it is.
Is it time?
So there it was.
There is but one thing to do.

And has it come to this?
But who was she?
And who are you?
Then make it up.
Can one see from there?
There he is, she said.
And when will you call?
How are you?
That is what she did.
Call him in.
And what do you make of it?
What time is it?
And what is that?
No was there one?
Do you know him?
Is he there?
Now is your time.
How is he?
But what will you do?
What did they do?
