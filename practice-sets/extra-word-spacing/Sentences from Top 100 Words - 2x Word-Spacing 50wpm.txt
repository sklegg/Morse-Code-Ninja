Has it come to this?
Who was that?
Now is your time.
But what have they been up to?
And do you like her?
Now what are we to do with you?
How is he?
Who are you?
Out of the way.
What was it?
What could it be?
Had to look the other way.
What is it for?
Do you see it?
And what do you make of it?
and so on, and so on.
Is he there?
But he had no time.
No was there one?
So it is.
But he had to have it.
But what is it?
So be it.
what has she to do with it?
And do you like him?
How is she?
Do you like him?
Then make it up.
What are we to do?
That is a long time.
But it has been so long.
And when will you call?
Is it time?
Can it be?
And what do you call her?
What do you see?
who can it be?
Who will go first?
Do you know him?
What will you do, then?
But what are you up to?
What can we do, then?
Did you see her?
It was from you.
How is he now?
How would you like to have it?
How did you come by it?
Is that it?
Would you do what he did?
That was it.
but what if it is?
what is it?
You know how it is with her.
but there was more to it than this.
You have it.
That will do, he said.
You can do it.
But will he see it?
You may go.
But when will that be?
You can have some.
How do you do?
Is that her?
What do they call you?
And is that all?
Go on, he said.
Look at him.
There they are.
There you are, he said.
And has it come to this?
Look at it.
One or two?
who, then, are you?
And who was that?
That is what she did.
Now you know.
Is it over?
Do as you like.
Did you know her?
Did you know them?
Which is it?
Then there is more to do.
What is it all about?
How did she do it?
How can it be?
Did you know him?
Then how many are there?
But what will you do?
Look over it.
He said no.
What is there to see?
We have him.
Then who are you?
What is that?
Who was he?
What can this be?
Did you see it?
So that was the way.
What DO you know of him?
What do you make of that?
Will that do?
When was it?
And could she see him?
But how about you?
Do you know what you look like?
And what did you do then?
We have no water.
You can go.
There he is, you see.
What did you do then?
but we can go and see.
Do you see him?
There you are.
Come this way.
Will you come and see her?
And all for what?
Call him in.
No one will come, she said.
are you there?
Are you there?
How are you?
Then, how do you know?
Or so they said.
And who are you?
What is he like?
You have them?
Tqhen you may go.
And what is that?
But it was of no use.
That will do, said he.
Is that all?
Do you know?
How was that?
Do they know him?
Can one see from there?
There is but one thing to do.
Is it like him?
What was it about?
Then what are you up to now?
How can you know?
What are you up to?
Do as you will.
The time had come.
Look at them.
How long has he been there?
When was that?
How did you know about it?
What other way is there to look at it?
Is she like him?
Who and what are you?
But so it is.
At what number?
She has it.
And who is this?
Do you know what it is?
But WHAT DID you see?
What have you come for?
Do you know her?
They said no more.
The time will come.
Who is she?
May we come in?
What do you make of it?
And what was it for?
And how did you find out?
There were two of them.
So it was.
Then what is it?
What is all this?
There he is, she said.
Look at it this way.
There he is, do you see him?
That was all she said.
What time is it?
At what time?
What would she have said?
What is it about?
Now there is no more to be said.
What did they do?
What was he like?
When is it?
How did he do it?
So there it was.
You know more than we do.
Would you like some?
And what did you see?
What is it like?
But who was she?
But how is that?
Can you do that?
What did he do to you?
Who was that?
What is it about?
That will do, he said.
Will you come and see her?
Or so they said.
And all for what?
So it is.
Then who are you?
But what is it?
We have him.
How did you know about it?
Then there is more to do.
And do you like her?
No was there one?

But what will you do?
But he had no time.
But he had to have it.
There he is, she said.
Is that all?
So be it.
It was from you.
How can you know?
But it was of no use.
There he is, you see.
