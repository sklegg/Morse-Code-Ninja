We got to let that go.
And there are four of you?
It was like new life to him.
Here is the paper.
Are you sure?
No, said the Tree.
Go to your father.
The children will live just the same.
No, said her father.
No, that can never be.
Tell us a story.
You must walk.
Write an answer.
She came in just now by the back door.
And what did you learn from him?
Have you been at sea?
Do you have the letter?
Is there any answer?
Are we late?
What would you have me do with my life?
Good night, friend.
That is the idea.
There were few near me.
Is my father here?
You are right, father.
Here is the book.
Come at once.
Let me out.
Let me get to work.
It was white.
Let me see her.
So they got out and went in.
We were together.
Where has she run off to?
what river is it?
Just cut it out.
This is what began it all.
This took him some time.
But why dont you want to take it?
It might help.
Let them have it.
He is always at it.
Who did you learn that from?
Then let me have a word with you.
Can you hear me?
She got up.
Who found them out?
We got one and they got one.
Point it at his horse.
Have you never been there?
Let me be and let me live.
There to the left.
They never did it again.
Who took him out of it?
What country does he come from?
No, never.
My father is right.
Ask one of those men.
No, why should he?
Take these, he said, and study them well.
Let me say one thing.
Our own people must come first.
You saw him?
Come over in the sun.
She is my friend.
There was no letter for me.
See him grow up.
It is well thought of.
Let me go to the door.
Open the door.
What do you hear?
But it is the same with any life.
Where have you been this long while?
Who can answer for that?
We never thought of that.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
Are you my friend?
Why, is it late?
Are we too late?
It is so very kind of you both.
You took it.
Let me go back.
Have you found it?
So he began to help.
Well, let us be sure of that.
Let me see him.
Life is all right.
Right here it began.
So it always was.
Is he a real father?
Sure of what?
He could run no more.
What is your real name?
Watch over him.
They came over last night.
Let me hear your story.
One of us will be here all night.
Think of my father.
At last we have a man.
Here is the letter.
He came at once.
How many are left?
Do you hear that?
Why dont you want to go?
Let us start, then.
Always the same, year after year.
If you know, why dont you tell?
It must be in her own house.
So take care of me.
Dont tell me.
He is at sea.
It is a long story.
They may tell us to open it.
It was then time to start.
But what did you hear?
It was the first thing he thought of.
What is life to you?
Come here, my friend.
Any book will tell you that.
She came over last night.
Cut your hand open?
Why should they?
One night more and he would be on his way.
He is my friend.
And he left the room.
And why should they?
He is my father.
Come let us see them.
One never has too much.
When did you begin?
Did you see his eye?
It is music.
Stop, let me show you the way.
Let her go.
How could you let him go so far?
It was his own room.
Then, good night.
How would they stop it?
Let me know at once when you will start.
Keep to the left.
This is real.
Was you in my room?
Which story was it?
She never came back.
What did he say in the letter?
it took all that time to come over the water.
We may be too late.
But you got to play music for them.
Dont you like it?
Do you want to cross?
For once you are right.
Let me see him at once.
Dont you think so?
Now or never.
Will you never learn?
Let him grow up with you.
Just set still and take it like a man.
Is it far?
Do you often come back?
She saw no one?
She is still here?
He saw his men draw back.
That was the first night.
Come, let us be men.
What do you think when you hear music?
Are you sure of it?
Keep watch all night.
Do you know where he is?
Well, what next?
You must study.
It is always so.
And now, good night.
By and by he got it.
Do we stop here?
Who could have thought it?
This took place at his house, in his room.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
You might want it.
Why is he cross with me?
We got under way at last.
But you must never tell.
You are sure of it?
Have you got it?
There, do you hear?
Stop, said he.
Call the next one.
Does he never go out?
Good for the country.
At four, she said.
How did it begin?
Dont you see that?
You got me?
But it is all all too late now.
They never come back.
Why, it was one of his own men.
You will answer for it.
Come eat with me.
She must have a hard time with him.
Just cut it out, will you?
But then it will be too late.
Dont move, he said.
Now let me have it.
He said at last.
Let me in.
We must begin again.
And now let us go home.
Let me hear what it is.
Who was the letter from?
What should he say?
She might be at his house.
Let him follow me.
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
He had two left feet.
Tell her to begin.
Let us cross over.
They are hard at it.
There are only four of us.
And your children?
That night we were just in time.
But it was very late.
You are sure he will keep his word with me?
Always the same with you people.
We must go at once.
We might learn a thing or two.
We should ask him.
He had only one night more to live.
Do you hear me?
Have you got that?
He might still be up.
And then we may begin.
But hard to tell.
Both of us.
It will be too late.
They always know.
Take care of him.
So, once more, good night.
It was very hard.
Look at his face.
No, stop.
A call for help, you thought?
What was left of him?
A second man got up and went out.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
He then said, It is time to start.
But are you sure of that?
Do you know what he did last night?
Dont say that to me.
But it would be in the paper.
This is my country.
No, dont.
And this food?
Do you have a car?
Music is a good thing.
And what did you do with that letter?
Is it in the city?
It would seem so.
You must never tell.
Let him answer us.
Let me look.
Let us go in.
Where could you keep it?
Stop and think.
These were the first people we saw.
You must eat now.
But they may still come here.
They dont know their own country.
He may come close.
We are together.
Let me see it.
It was the last day of the year.
How many children?
Give me the letter.
You found him?
Which end is his head?
They are always the same.
Who should it be?
We should look at this.
She saw it.
What was it that you thought?
Few had found it.
Where is the river?
What did he answer?
Watch him, he said.
But then you would be close to the sea?
But watch over him.
One was on a white horse.
First turn to the left.
Why do you stop here?
Is that far?
Do you want some more to eat?
You are sure of that?
It is open?
Tell me more.
Well, run back to her.
Never see him again.
Now you must eat.
Just a few.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
It is from your father.
Here he is at last.
Let us go back.
We found it.
But she saw no one?
Why dont you play?
Why should this be so?
Well, read the letter again.
Only, dont look back.
Off with her head.
The other night she left.
But now it is too late.
And then they began to fish.
Who said four?
You have a car?
Do you know how he made his mark?
Who let you in?
Let me get on with my work.
He has been been found.
Can you stand?
Why, dont you hear it?
Good night again.
He has children of his own.
Take care.
What do you think of the music?
Say good night.
There was no answer.
Cut him down.
And who is this friend?
But let us walk.
To the left.
Off with his head.
Dont you want any?
How much have you got?
Where is this city?
What did you hear?
And she left the room.
In the country?
There is only food for one.
The sun had set long since.
What was the name of the man who took it?
What a start that was.
What a night it has been.
You should take me there one day.
Still, you never know.
We are very far from that.
Let me have a word with you.
They dont care.
Here we see the boy at school.
Keep to the right.
But take care.
How could you begin?
At this time of my life, no.
We dont see it like that.
