Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
She had very little notice from him.
Your true father?
Much of it was true.
This is simple.
What will happen now?
You are on a ship?
It was true to life.
That would be the best way.
Are you here on leave?
Do you remember?
Look to the west.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Half a mile?
It was all she could do to hold in.
How many children did he leave?
That is enough for me.
She is the first person in this house.
Answer me this one question.
Now, listen.
What can happen?
Have you heard?
He never told us what it was she said.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
Let me also ask you a question.
Then you will know me better.
Why do they want to make her sing?
Ten, did you say?
We were up early.
Can she sing?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Take a hold of it.
No, my love.
Listen to him.
She told me all about it.
Which king?
We had a list.
You will soon know.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
It would have been more simple.
What do you mean by that question?
So do you, my love.
He is very simple.
Put down three and carry five.
You are right, young man.
What a state he was in.
How could that happen?
Is your family well?
It is cold.
How does this happen?
No more money?
How short his time.
She was a good girl.
And why do you serve?
Try it on the dog first.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
That must be true.
A better man than you.
who told you you could?
In an hour?
And so they knew that it was true.
But listen to me.
We will talk about that.
Does she go fast?
Remember that time?
Where did they get the money from?
Do you want any money?
Well, are you ready?
He is better than any of you.
You saw the person?
He never heard.
Let me see him, said the young man.
Why do we love?
A young man?
Had they been heard?
You are a good girl.
This was true.
A house is on fire?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
He said, the work is now complete.
It is a young girl.
Feel better then.
No, he is a man about my size.
Where he was, no one knew.
Long live the king.
Can it be true?
That was the rule, she said.
Why do you serve?
you must step out.
You know me well enough.
Better write it here.
You are right, my love.
They left in the morning.
But one day you must feel it.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Let us talk a little about my father.
Five young children.
But he never heard me.
Better cross here.
Who told you so?
You may leave the room.
They had several children.
It is a fire.
Read them, said the King.
And you can sing?
You are cold.
Never heard of it.
You remember the place, my father?
They told me to.
The night was cold.
Will you answer that question?
She must be told.
You are better than that.
Is that true?
About the usual time.
We are ready.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Who was it told me his name?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
She told me to ask you.
What is there to talk about?
We took our leave early, and left together.
Let me remember what he said.
Leave me out of the question.
They are still young.
There was no wind.
Listen to them, he said.
What a question.
Then get ready at once.
Did you get any money?
Never heard of him.
It is a rock.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
We got her half way.
She was only a little girl.
An example would be better.
Made me feel so young.
Long and the short of it.
It would be better if you went to the war.
you should know her better than me.
How did this happen?
Did they ever go back?
Take notice.
When do you leave?
They knew it.
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
But how simple it is.
From then on it was war between them.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Are you ready to play?
Are you ready?
Leave off that.
Do you know that old lay?
Who told you that?
And what does she want the money for?
We serve them.
Pass this way, then.
Was he young or old?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
He got it this morning.
That is true.
You may go, said the King.
He had my love.
Pull together.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Take good care of the little girl.
He knew them.
Where are you off to so early?
Is the wind north or south?
And how did he make his money?
And serve them right.
So the question was, what to do?
So we came down this road.
He put his hand over part of the map.
They had much to talk about.
How does it feel?
One other question, said he.
To know her is to love her.
Leave any for him?
Every word you said was heard.
It is true.
We dont know enough.
But what did we ever get for it?
Then what would happen?
But listen to this, he said.
Do you remember him?
What does he feel?
That is very simple.
The King Went to him.
Are they made to order?
What is love?
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Why talk to me?
No less, no more.
Fire and water, earth and air.
Let us talk about you.
You can pass through the door.
You have an hour.
Half as many is too much.
They had heard all that before.
This is my body.
Are we ready?
And that is the whole point.
Have you told her?
But enough of this.
How do you feel now?
But why must you leave me so soon?
We call it black.
He will leave me.
It has been there ever since.
What will happen to us?
Do you love me?
It can never happen.
He had enough of it.
Well, young man?
She was so young, too.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
It will interest you, said he.
What have you heard?
Listen to this, will you?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
But she is very young.
You had better go.
She knew what was good for children.
They all heard me.
On fire, on fire.
Before you leave, tell us.
Have you heard from him often?
It is the rule.
You must leave that to me.
Let me hear from you soon.
Now listen to me.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
what could be better?
Can you sing?
And you will always love him?
And will you direct us?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Ask them to sing one more song.
And dont talk to me.
Do you own a dog?
She is very plain.
But let that pass.
The family was at home.
How soon will he be here?
Let this man pass.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
This will pass in no time.
This money was for her.
If you know it, that is enough.
She is much better.
Are you still cold?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
She is fast?
We must make the best of it.
You love him?
In an hour it will be at the door.
And so they began to talk.
In short, take me.
It was cold.
How do you feel?
We knew them both.
That was the question.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Have you a family?
The world is big enough.
You will always love him?
You are in love with me?
Against what side?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Why did it happen?
Never heard of it before.
We had better go in.
Pull it more to your side.
An hour and a half.
Is it true?
What have you against me now?
Listen to me.
Let that pass.
Are you better?
How far from the body?
Does he love you?
Light my fire.
Your watch is slow.
It was true.
Are you all ready?
There are four hundred?
She knew at once.
Let us leave them, she said.
He said, get him out of the road.
Are you in love with her?
And you are still so young.
That may be true.
And then he told all he knew.
Little girl, where have you been?
You were told.
Hold it up to the light.
Let us pass.
Better late than never.
Young man, you will go far.
Did he though?
Do you remember me?
The rock was very small.
Did you tell him your whole story?
Keep in step.
I have no children to love me.
You must travel.
The dog is always with him.
If you only knew.
He has money.
It was a round table.
They can have all our half of the house.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
What kind of a bird?
Is your man white or black?
Ten will be early enough.
Had you heard?
Hold her hand.
That is enough.
you know better than that.
When did this happen?
Do you love her much?
As soon as you left, it began.
What size do you want?
The night was cold and still.
Has she any family?
