Answer me this one question.
Have you told her?
They left in the morning.
Never heard of it.
A young man?
The world is big enough.
They had much to talk about.
Well, young man?
Are we ready?
In an hour it will be at the door.
A better man than you.
Who told you that?
Against what side?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Can it be true?
That must be true.
We had better go in.
Never heard of him.
Is that true?
Better cross here.
Why do you serve?
We call it black.
Where are you off to so early?
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
When do you leave?
Take good care of the little girl.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
Are you all ready?
Then what would happen?
How far from the body?
You had better go.
Listen to me.
That is true.
Take a hold of it.
You are right, my love.
He is better than any of you.
And dont talk to me.
There was no wind.
That may be true.
That was the question.
Let us pass.
Do you own a dog?
And so they began to talk.
But enough of this.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
Are you here on leave?
This will pass in no time.
We had a list.
From then on it was war between them.
Let me hear from you soon.
The dog is always with him.
What have you heard?
Where he was, no one knew.
They had several children.
It was all she could do to hold in.
Now, listen.
How does it feel?
They all heard me.
What is love?
It is a young girl.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Five young children.
It was cold.
Why did it happen?
And what does she want the money for?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
And so they knew that it was true.
One other question, said he.
Do you remember me?
But what did we ever get for it?
What a question.
We were up early.
Ask them to sing one more song.
Was he young or old?
You are a good girl.
Your watch is slow.
Can she sing?
As soon as you left, it began.
Young man, you will go far.
But why must you leave me so soon?
Are you in love with her?
Better write it here.
Why do they want to make her sing?
But one day you must feel it.
We are ready.
Do you remember him?
And why do you serve?
Made me feel so young.
Listen to this, will you?
Well, are you ready?
When did this happen?
And that is the whole point.
Every word you said was heard.
Why talk to me?
That would be the best way.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
And you are still so young.
Listen to him.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
But let that pass.
She is the first person in this house.
But he never heard me.
It is true.
We knew them both.
You are in love with me?
How short his time.
Why do we love?
you must step out.
It was true.
An example would be better.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
You will always love him?
Half a mile?
So the question was, what to do?
Do you want any money?
Is the wind north or south?
Are you still cold?
You are on a ship?
He put his hand over part of the map.
Did he though?
Pull together.
Had they been heard?
No more money?
Do you remember?
Try it on the dog first.
Then she told me to try for the next one.
You have an hour.
Had you heard?
That is enough for me.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
She had very little notice from him.
This is simple.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
That is very simple.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
Ten will be early enough.
And then he told all he knew.
Pull it more to your side.
She is fast?
Read them, said the King.
She must be told.
How many children did he leave?
But listen to me.
You know me well enough.
Hold her hand.
She knew what was good for children.
It would have been more simple.
You must travel.
Leave off that.
Are you better?
It has been there ever since.
In an hour?
And you can sing?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Light my fire.
We must make the best of it.
Let this man pass.
Pass this way, then.
This was true.
Half as many is too much.
He knew them.
But she is very young.
who told you you could?
It is a rock.
She told me to ask you.
Did you get any money?
Are they made to order?
The King Went to him.
Do you love her much?
Let me also ask you a question.
They had heard all that before.
Let me see him, said the young man.
The night was cold and still.
It was a round table.
Then get ready at once.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Your true father?
We serve them.
She is much better.
He will leave me.
We got her half way.
Let us leave them, she said.
We dont know enough.
He had my love.
Let that pass.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Leave me out of the question.
He is very simple.
Listen to them, he said.
To know her is to love her.
The rock was very small.
How soon will he be here?
you should know her better than me.
He had enough of it.
He has money.
And serve them right.
Does she go fast?
Look to the west.
No, he is a man about my size.
No less, no more.
That was the rule, she said.
It was true to life.
You love him?
Will you answer that question?
Does he love you?
It is a fire.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
You are cold.
You can pass through the door.
What does he feel?
Leave any for him?
If you only knew.
Put down three and carry five.
About the usual time.
Are you ready?
This is my body.
Feel better then.
Have you heard from him often?
No, my love.
He never told us what it was she said.
Is your man white or black?
What do you mean by that question?
You are right, young man.
They are still young.
There are four hundred?
But how simple it is.
Ten, did you say?
You were told.
It would be better if you went to the war.
She is very plain.
Much of it was true.
What have you against me now?
Has she any family?
It is cold.
They can have all our half of the house.
In short, take me.
How do you feel?
A house is on fire?
Did they ever go back?
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
Is it true?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
Have you a family?
If you know it, that is enough.
Who was it told me his name?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Take notice.
What will happen now?
You may go, said the King.
You will soon know.
They told me to.
what could be better?
Never heard of it before.
Are you ready to play?
Long live the king.
Let us talk about you.
Let us talk a little about my father.
Who told you so?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
How could that happen?
The family was at home.
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
You must leave that to me.
The night was cold.
He said, get him out of the road.
Long and the short of it.
This money was for her.
Better late than never.
Is your family well?
What size do you want?
It is the rule.
Do you know that old lay?
You remember the place, my father?
He never heard.
Let me remember what he said.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Now listen to me.
Hold it up to the light.
How did this happen?
Which king?
I have no children to love me.
Little girl, where have you been?
you know better than that.
What kind of a bird?
We took our leave early, and left together.
An hour and a half.
Keep in step.
Then you will know me better.
How do you feel now?
Remember that time?
She knew at once.
Do you love me?
She was so young, too.
So do you, my love.
She told me all about it.
So we came down this road.
He said, the work is now complete.
We will talk about that.
What a state he was in.
Where did they get the money from?
Fire and water, earth and air.
You are better than that.
It will interest you, said he.
You may leave the room.
Before you leave, tell us.
And you will always love him?
And will you direct us?
Have you heard?
She was a good girl.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
They knew it.
And how did he make his money?
On fire, on fire.
What will happen to us?
What is there to talk about?
How does this happen?
What can happen?
You saw the person?
But listen to this, he said.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
It can never happen.
That is enough.
She was only a little girl.
Can you sing?
Did you tell him your whole story?
There was no time to think of what might happen.
He got it this morning.
