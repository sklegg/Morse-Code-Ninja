If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
No, my love.
Take a hold of it.
He is very simple.
I have no children to love me.
Little girl, where have you been?
Which king?
Made me feel so young.
But she is very young.
Leave off that.
Do you remember me?
And so they knew that it was true.
This is simple.
Listen to me.
Are you all ready?
This will pass in no time.
Well, are you ready?
Young man, you will go far.
They left in the morning.
Leave me out of the question.
It is cold.
What a state he was in.
How could that happen?
Are you in love with her?
It was true to life.
One other question, said he.
That must be true.
We dont know enough.
Did they ever go back?
So do you, my love.
Hold her hand.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
Does she go fast?
It was cold.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
Better write it here.
He said, get him out of the road.
The dog is always with him.
He never told us what it was she said.
Hold it up to the light.
Let me see him, said the young man.
We took our leave early, and left together.
Do you love me?
How does this happen?
She is fast?
Do you want any money?
When do you leave?
Never heard of it.
That would be the best way.
The night was cold.
Had you heard?
Read them, said the King.
She was a good girl.
What will happen to us?
Why do you serve?
Ten, did you say?
They told me to.
The family was at home.
Let me also ask you a question.
Me to the North, and you to the South.
That was the rule, she said.
About the usual time.
Let that pass.
But listen to this, he said.
Did you tell him your whole story?
Feel better then.
You had better go.
That is very simple.
They had heard all that before.
Can she sing?
Pass this way, then.
Half a mile?
How did this happen?
So the question was, what to do?
It will interest you, said he.
Your watch is slow.
Leave any for him?
We will talk about that.
Are you here on leave?
What a question.
One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
They are still young.
You will soon know.
What size do you want?
You can pass through the door.
He is better than any of you.
How does it feel?
She must be told.
How far from the body?
who told you you could?
you know better than that.
This money was for her.
He put his hand over part of the map.
Have you heard from him often?
This is my body.
When did this happen?
How many children did he leave?
Answer me this one question.
What is love?
Is your family well?
Why talk to me?
Five young children.
Does he love you?
We serve them.
She is the first person in this house.
Was he young or old?
It can never happen.
That may be true.
They all heard me.
Now listen to me.
Let me hear from you soon.
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
She knew at once.
Do you remember?
Long and the short of it.
You are cold.
On fire, on fire.
We call it black.
As soon as you left, it began.
In an hour it will be at the door.
Ten will be early enough.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
In short, take me.
They had much to talk about.
An hour and a half.
And that is the whole point.
Listen to them, he said.
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
How do you feel?
Then what would happen?
What will happen now?
Is it true?
He never heard.
What does he feel?
And you will always love him?
We were up early.
To know her is to love her.
Never heard of it before.
Light my fire.
No, he is a man about my size.
The world is big enough.
We got her half way.
Are you better?
Are you still cold?
Why did it happen?
Are you ready?
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
Let us pass.
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
Let this man pass.
She told me all about it.
We are ready.
But what did we ever get for it?
Before you leave, tell us.
And so they began to talk.
And you are still so young.
How do you feel now?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
what could be better?
You know me well enough.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
An example would be better.
Is your man white or black?
Better late than never.
You have an hour.
What is there to talk about?
Long live the king.
We had a list.
We must try to find him, said the girl.
That is true.
A young man?
Are they made to order?
What have you heard?
Listen to him.
But how simple it is.
He knew them.
No less, no more.
Do you remember him?
From then on it was war between them.
How short his time.
And then he told all he knew.
Have you a family?
You were told.
You are right, my love.
You will always love him?
There was no wind.
You saw the person?
And you can sing?
Ask them to sing one more song.
A house is on fire?
We knew that before long the sun would set.
You are a good girl.
If you know it, that is enough.
You are better than that.
Are we ready?
Are you ready to play?
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Can it be true?
You are in love with me?
What can happen?
That was the question.
What do you mean by that question?
Then he saw through the whole thing.
Against what side?
You may go, said the King.
And why do you serve?
Then you will know me better.
Keep in step.
You may leave the room.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Have you told her?
And dont talk to me.
Half as many is too much.
What kind of a bird?
Pull it more to your side.
Did you get any money?
It would have been more simple.
Why do they want to make her sing?
Is that true?
We had better go in.
Take good care of the little girl.
Do you know that old lay?
Had they been heard?
He has money.
No more money?
Pull together.
Has she any family?
She is much better.
But enough of this.
The rock was very small.
you must step out.
She was so young, too.
You are right, young man.
Listen to this, will you?
But he never heard me.
But one day you must feel it.
It is a fire.
Remember that time?
He got it this morning.
Now, listen.
He said, the work is now complete.
But why must you leave me so soon?
That is enough.
Then get ready at once.
you should know her better than me.
It was all she could do to hold in.
You must travel.
Where he was, no one knew.
Who told you so?
You have your whole life before you, she said.
It was true.
She knew what was good for children.
We must make the best of it.
Better cross here.
In an hour?
Can you sing?
Her only thought was to reach his side.
But let that pass.
And will you direct us?
Who was it told me his name?
Who told you that?
You love him?
This was true.
Why do we love?
She had very little notice from him.
And what does she want the money for?
That is enough for me.
But listen to me.
Have you heard?
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
Put down three and carry five.
Where did they get the money from?
Will you answer that question?
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
You remember the place, my father?
Your true father?
She was only a little girl.
Well, young man?
She told me to ask you.
It was a round table.
Never heard of him.
We knew them both.
It is the rule.
Do you own a dog?
It is a young girl.
You are on a ship?
Do you love her much?
A better man than you.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Much of it was true.
They had several children.
Did he though?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
And how did he make his money?
He had my love.
Fire and water, earth and air.
They can have all our half of the house.
They knew it.
He will leave me.
So we came down this road.
There are four hundred?
If you only knew.
It would be better if you went to the war.
Let us talk a little about my father.
Let me remember what he said.
Every word you said was heard.
What have you against me now?
Is the wind north or south?
You must leave that to me.
She is very plain.
Let us leave them, she said.
It is true.
Take notice.
And serve them right.
It has been there ever since.
He had enough of it.
Where are you off to so early?
The King Went to him.
It is a rock.
Try it on the dog first.
Let us talk about you.
The night was cold and still.
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
How soon will he be here?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Look to the west.
