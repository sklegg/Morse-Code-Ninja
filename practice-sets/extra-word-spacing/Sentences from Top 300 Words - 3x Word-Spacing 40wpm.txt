You are sure he will keep his word with me?
But what is it, and where is it to be found?
He has been been found.
We dont see it like that.
Take care.
Well, read the letter again.
Come, let us be men.
Let us go in.
There is only food for one.
But what did you hear?
How could you begin?
One was on a white horse.
What do you hear?
She might be at his house.
What is life to you?
It is well thought of.
Who did you learn that from?
They never come back.
How did it begin?
And she left the room.
Where is this city?
Do you want to cross?
Off with his head.
But are you sure of that?
She must have a hard time with him.
And now, good night.
We never thought of that.
Is it in the city?
They are hard at it.
This is what began it all.
You must never tell.
At last we have a man.
Dont say that to me.
Cut your hand open?
He might still be up.
Write an answer.
By and by he got it.
We are together.
When did you begin?
But take care.
Why dont you play?
Is that far?
You must walk.
Just cut it out, will you?
Why, it was one of his own men.
Let us go back.
Does he never go out?
But it is the same with any life.
So he began to help.
You got me?
Life is all right.
It is from your father.
Well, run back to her.
Keep watch all night.
My father is right.
He has children of his own.
There are only four of us.
Then let me have a word with you.
Here is the letter.
They may tell us to open it.
Let me hear what it is.
And what did you do with that letter?
It is music.
So it always was.
Let me be and let me live.
It is open?
But watch over him.
Have you got it?
He had two left feet.
Come eat with me.
Where could you keep it?
Take care of him.
There was no letter for me.
They are always the same.
And this food?
Music is a good thing.
Do we stop here?
Let him follow me.
Cut him down.
Our own people must come first.
It might help.
Why should they?
Is my father here?
How would they stop it?
She got up.
This is real.
But it would be in the paper.
He may come close.
You have a car?
Stop, let me show you the way.
These were the first people we saw.
Then, good night.
Which end is his head?
You saw him?
Dont you want any?
Are we late?
Here he is at last.
What should he say?
No, why should he?
Let me say one thing.
Let me out.
So they got out and went in.
Do you know what he did last night?
Let me go to the door.
Now let me have it.
We must go at once.
We should ask him.
He had no idea how long he had been there.
Only, dont look back.
No, stop.
Do you know how he made his mark?
Do you know where he is?
What do you think of the music?
Is there any answer?
Dont tell me.
Let me see it.
She is still here?
We may be too late.
She came over last night.
If you know, why dont you tell?
Let me see him at once.
One never has too much.
There, do you hear?
Come here, my friend.
You might want it.
Give me the letter.
Tell us a story.
You know all the men from this part of the country.
We got to let that go.
What country does he come from?
Dont you think so?
That was the first night.
It must be in her own house.
Never see him again.
But she saw no one?
A call for help, you thought?
But now it is too late.
That is the idea.
We were together.
Well, let us be sure of that.
What a start that was.
It was like new life to him.
How much have you got?
Are you sure?
And then we may begin.
No, said the Tree.
But then you would be close to the sea?
Just set still and take it like a man.
Stop and think.
Let me see her.
Who should it be?
Is it far?
What do you think when you hear music?
He is always at it.
And he left the room.
what river is it?
Do you hear me?
See him grow up.
He saw his men draw back.
Can you stand?
You must eat now.
What was left of him?
Let me get on with my work.
Where have you been this long while?
You found him?
Let me go back.
Few had found it.
We are very far from that.
Do you have a car?
Who can answer for that?
Do you hear that?
Point it at his horse.
She came in just now by the back door.
Open the door.
She is my friend.
Ask one of those men.
Who could have thought it?
Now or never.
Can you hear me?
Look at his face.
But then it will be too late.
What was it that you thought?
They came over last night.
Why do you stop here?
Let me know at once when you will start.
Let me in.
Now you must eat.
It was very hard.
It is always so.
First turn to the left.
It was white.
We got under way at last.
Are we too late?
And now let us go home.
The other night she left.
Good night again.
But you got to play music for them.
He is at sea.
And there are four of you?
Stop, said he.
Who found them out?
There were few near me.
Who said four?
The sun had set long since.
So take care of me.
Why should this be so?
You are right, father.
Well, what next?
Here we see the boy at school.
And then they began to fish.
At this time of my life, no.
Let him grow up with you.
It was then time to start.
Have you found it?
It was the last day of the year.
Just cut it out.
Why, is it late?
You are sure of that?
How many children?
Let us start, then.
It was his own room.
So, once more, good night.
Always the same with you people.
She never came back.
Dont you like it?
Are you my friend?
He could run no more.
But it is all all too late now.
They dont care.
Is he a real father?
She saw no one?
This took him some time.
Both of us.
Here is the paper.
How could you let him go so far?
Let me see him.
Come let us see them.
He came at once.
Well, here we are at last, said one of them.
There was no answer.
And your children?
It would seem so.
He is my friend.
Let me have a word with you.
Do you want some more to eat?
He is my father.
What was the name of the man who took it?
Come at once.
What did he say in the letter?
But hard to tell.
That night we were just in time.
You are sure of it?
Did you see his eye?
Let me get to work.
There to the left.
Say good night.
It was the first thing he thought of.
What did you hear?
We found it.
But why dont you want to take it?
It is a long story.
Think of my father.
This took place at his house, in his room.
Go back and keep an eye on the children.
Let me look.
A second man got up and went out.
Let him answer us.
You should take me there one day.
They never did it again.
Watch over him.
It is so very kind of you both.
Are you sure of it?
Do you often come back?
We got one and they got one.
The children will live just the same.
Take these, he said, and study them well.
What did he answer?
Where is the river?
Watch him, he said.
Tell her to begin.
Right here it began.
Do you have the letter?
Have you got that?
What would you have me do with my life?
Who took him out of it?
How many are left?
Let us cross over.
Go to your father.
You will answer for it.
He had only one night more to live.
And who is this friend?
Who was the letter from?
Have you never been there?
No, that can never be.
She saw it.
He said at last.
We might learn a thing or two.
This is my country.
We must begin again.
Why is he cross with me?
Sure of what?
They always know.
Which story was it?
One night more and he would be on his way.
Any book will tell you that.
But it was very late.
Tell me more.
No, never.
For once you are right.
But let us walk.
Still, you never know.
What a night it has been.
In the country?
Come over in the sun.
Where has she run off to?
To the left.
Have you been at sea?
He then said, It is time to start.
And what did you learn from him?
We should look at this.
Why dont you want to go?
One of us will be here all night.
Always the same, year after year.
Let her go.
Why, dont you hear it?
You must study.
You took it.
Let them have it.
But you must never tell.
No, said her father.
It will be too late.
Call the next one.
it took all that time to come over the water.
What is your real name?
Dont move, he said.
But they may still come here.
Will you never learn?
Let me hear your story.
Keep to the right.
Here is the book.
Keep to the left.
Dont you see that?
No, dont.
At four, she said.
No one would have thought the end was so near.
They dont know their own country.
Good night, friend.
Just a few.
Was you in my room?
Good for the country.
Off with her head.
And why should they?
Who let you in?
