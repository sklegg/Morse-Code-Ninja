Good to rest once in a way.
Like these in shape and size?
You love a certain person.
What age is he?
Keep clear of him.
Oh, take me with you.
Hold on a minute.
She began to cry.
We must be quick.
What a game.
Oh, nothing.
Well yes, you are right.
Money is no object?
She gave me her hand.
Do you have my note?
Her voice was low.
It has to be done.
Yes, and no.
There is your old bed.
It is certain.
It was a record run.
He left long ago.
What did the letter contain?
All was dark.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Oh, but you were there?
It is nothing.
Well, what about my plan?
Yes, she could sing that.
There was more to be done.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
He had made up his mind.
We know from the record that he was on the water.
But let us see your plan.
Oh, all right.
His plan is very simple.
It must be done.
Free to do what?
That would be a fine thing.
People might know my voice and find me out.
It was so very long ago.
But what must be done?
But wait a minute.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
And here is the note.
This is a test.
Yes, you are right.
Decide if you are going back home.
No, nothing of the kind.
She was still game.
Laugh, if you will.
Bring it here.
And you can do nothing until then?
Then all was dark again.
In that town there is a street.
We are free to act and think.
And sit in the dark?
Is it certain?
He began to laugh.
Wait and see.
But they could see nothing.
You can hear that, miss?
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
He never said nothing.
Then lead the way.
They know nothing about it.
Come, and we can rest together.
And yet you are the better off?
All that for nothing?
Of course he was right.
Well, but where can he fly to?
What have they done?
Take good note of it.
Your voice is that of a young man.
They call him a fine boy.
Why did you bring him here?
Nothing had come of it.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
The snow is deep.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Very well, wait a minute.
Wonder is it like that.
Can it be possible?
Who brought you up?
It was a very dark night.
You know nothing about it.
He was here a minute ago.
Go and rest.
Oh, he is so kind.
He will sleep an hour.
It was a cold, dark night.
How long ago?
Oh, tell me.
Of course it might.
It must be done at once.
In a minute.
Clear the way.
He is in the box.
Oh, that.
How is that done?
His first cry was for his father.
You must stay with me.
See what you have done.
Oh, if men only knew.
Be back in a minute.
What more is to be done?
Are they on foot?
Then it is certain?
Yes, sit down.
She could think of nothing more to say.
We brought them in.
Oh, come now.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Yes, of course.
Clear my name.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
He has a good voice still.
What brought you here?
Let us sit down.
Is that a fact?
Wait for me here, all of you.
There is a lot of people.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Half the town was there.
Is my father in town?
Oh, go on.
But what then must be done?
Lead me to him.
It is a real bed.
It is his voice.
Of course they will.
Oh, this is too much.
Well, sit down.
Help me sit up.
Fine, very fine.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
Yes, it is true.
You brought no one with you?
My mind was soon made up.
Yes, all right.
Of course it is.
The whole night the tree stood still.
Which box do you mean?
What is power?
Nothing she can eat?
Oh, no.
Wait for me.
What kind of voice is it?
Oh, do the best you can.
Yes, go and find out.
Just go to sleep.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
And yet you said he had money.
It was right in front of us.
She heard and saw nothing.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
Come quick.
It is done.
The city was soon behind me.
Yes, but only for you and me.
Wonder what he does.
How can a little dog laugh?
Yes, my love?
Will you rest here a little?
How was that possible?
Go back to bed.
What has he done?
Perhaps you would like to read it.
He must be in the same boat as us.
Get to bed.
Yes, once.
Well, what does that lead up to?
He stood up.
But that is nothing to us.
Oh, do as you like.
He gave me this paper.
It was cold and dark.
You better stay here all night.
His will be done.
Oh, just listen.
It is very clear.
A fine thing too.
What is done is done.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
How long would you keep me in town?
Wait a minute.
Well, miss?
Did it all rest on me?
Did he fall?
Is he in bed?
Well, there he stood.
What can be done?
He brought it with him for us to see.
Oh, how can you sleep?
But it must be done soon.
It might have done me good.
Yes, but what did she say?
You must stay.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
The whole day had been hot.
Oh, take those off.
Then he must be a wonder.
It was so long ago.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
Who gave it to you?
Oh, dont ask me.
Oh, you are there.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
He knew nothing.
Yes, that was a picture book.
Answer me that, miss.
What have they done with my work?
All of this was possible.
Yes, she said.
It is no use, said a voice.
Sit down, he said.
Well, of course.
Where can you wait for me?
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Oh, man.
Play the game out.
You are in my power.
Stay where you are.
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
But never mind that.
That is possible.
Just let us go free.
Well then, be quick.
It was a kind of language between us.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Yes, he did.
At his side was a large green box.
There is nothing more to be said.
All right then, sit down.
Let him go free?
It was very dark.
It is possible.
He saw nothing.
He must wait.
It was hot.
She got her hand free.
Did she fall?
It was full of people.
Now we must wait.
Of course she will.
It stood behind the door.
Nothing could be more simple.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
If only they would be quick.
and so he decide he go back home.
Sit down, said the old man.
Never mind me.
And what have you done to me?
The night was dark.
She brought it home in less than an hour.
The little boy lay in his bed.
Try to sleep.
Again came the voice.
What have you done?
He is among us.
Never mind how he came here.
Bring this with you.
This voice was that of my father.
And what a voice she has.
Well, sit down by me.
Oh let me in.
It is all done.
That was well done.
It is time for bed.
Money is power.
You will fall.
Do you see that island?
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
There, by the wheel.
Is it possible?
Here is our plan.
You knew it, and said nothing?
Yes, we know that.
Do you talk in your sleep?
How was it done?
Look at that dark water.
Fly, my friend.
They would cry.
It was done.
It was a warm night.
We are more strong together.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
It was a dark night.
Yes, that is true.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Oh, to be sure.
Nothing is more simple.
Oh, of course.
You must have a rest.
He had, to be sure, done much.
Is that possible?
He ran up to them.
Yes and no.
Yes, to be sure.
The water ran dry.
Are you strong?
Perhaps he did.
The night was very dark.
Nothing at all.
Wait a second.
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
Come, let me show you my plan.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Wonder if he has a name.
Yes, he said, all of it.
You know you must say yes.
But she is nothing to me now.
And then the game began all over again.
Yes, he said.
Nothing new under the sun.
Why, of course.
Why should my father fly?
The island was a mile long.
Let her wait.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Did she stay long?
This made him wonder more and more.
Clear the table.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Oh, that is very simple.
Oh, do you know?
You are free to do so.
Yes, there it is.
is it come yet?
Leave the rest to me.
No, nothing at all.
Nothing could have been better.
Never mind that.
They all fall to the ground.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Yes, said the old man.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
Oh, very well, he said.
Go in there and drive them out.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
Let me see your plan.
That is a fact.
My mind is made up.
Yes, very well.
Behind my bed.
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Better sit still.
I hear his voice in the house.
What has brought you here?
Yes, what is it?
You can sleep here.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Yes, she was back.
Yes, go on.
They need a rest.
But how long ago?
And he told you nothing?
Dont laugh.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
There is no possible way.
The old man gave no answer.
It was brought to me.
Yes, it did.
Bring them here.
Behind every book is a man.
Quick, friend, quick.
