One or the other of you is for ever in the way.
It is true.
It is cold.
And you are still so young.
The family was at home.
Is it true?
Me to the North, and you to the South.
you should know her better than me.
She had very little notice from him.
Hold her hand.
She knew at once.
And dont talk to me.
Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
It was true.
Are you in love with her?
She told me all about it.
Hold it up to the light.
Long live the king.
What can happen?
On fire, on fire.
Leave off that.
Ten will be early enough.
Have you told her?
We knew them both.
What a question.
Leave any for him?
Fire and water, earth and air.
They are still young.
The night was cold.
Are you all ready?
Does he love you?
She is the first person in this house.
Do you remember?
I have no children to love me.
Can you sing?
No, he is a man about my size.
And then he told all he knew.
Let me hear from you soon.
And will you direct us?
When do you leave?
We must try to find him, said the girl.
Had you heard?
What will happen now?
You love him?
It was all she could do to hold in.
If you know it, that is enough.
Before you leave, tell us.
The King Went to him.
How does it feel?
When they told us, she was well out to sea.
Have you a family?
Did they ever go back?
There was no wind.
But one day you must feel it.
Why did it happen?
you must step out.
What could we do if he were to leave us.
Let me remember what he said.
It is a young girl.
How short his time.
Take a hold of it.
Much of it was true.
A house is on fire?
It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.
Little girl, where have you been?
It is a rock.
What have you heard?
It was true to life.
Can she sing?
You are in love with me?
Are they made to order?
What is love?
You must leave that to me.
What do you mean by that question?
If you only knew.
That would be the best way.
But let that pass.
How do you feel now?
Do you remember me?
And so they knew that it was true.
Leave me out of the question.
We knew that before long the sun would set.
Can it be true?
Let us pass.
You were told.
who told you you could?
She is very plain.
You are a good girl.
Do you want any money?
You can pass through the door.
Lay your hand on this book and say it.
Listen to me.
Listen to them, he said.
We had a list.
She must be told.
Put down three and carry five.
And why do you serve?
They knew it.
Is your family well?
She knew what was good for children.
Pull it more to your side.
He will leave me.
They had several children.
We call it black.
He never told us what it was she said.
He is better than any of you.
She was a good girl.
The night was cold and still.
Listen to this, will you?
It was the best thing that could happen to him.
Are we ready?
No less, no more.
You are cold.
No, my love.
Well, are you ready?
She did it ever so much better than her mother.
Then you will know me better.
Never heard of it.
About the usual time.
Pull together.
She told me to ask you.
And that is the whole point.
Are you ready to play?
He knew them.
Did he though?
She is much better.
But listen to this, he said.
We had better go in.
He never heard.
Are you here on leave?
Are you ready?
How far from the body?
Why do they want to make her sing?
Who was it told me his name?
That was the question.
what could be better?
They all heard me.
Then he saw through the whole thing.
She was so young, too.
If they hear of this, will they let it pass?
Let me see him, said the young man.
We took our leave early, and left together.
They can have all our half of the house.
A young man?
Then she told me to try for the next one.
What a state he was in.
Will you answer that question?
Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.
How did this happen?
That is enough for me.
He said, the work is now complete.
An hour and a half.
Do you know that old lay?
One other question, said he.
Why do you serve?
Who told you so?
Are you better?
Try it on the dog first.
When did this happen?
You will always love him?
What does he feel?
Where he was, no one knew.
You saw the person?
Then get ready at once.
Never heard of him.
But listen to me.
You may go, said the King.
They told me to.
you know better than that.
And serve them right.
Do you love me?
Pass this way, then.
Read them, said the King.
He has money.
Listen to him.
Why talk to me?
Well, young man?
Half as many is too much.
An example would be better.
Is your man white or black?
Better cross here.
What is there to talk about?
But she is very young.
You have your whole life before you, she said.
And you can sing?
Have you heard?
Your true father?
You must travel.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?
But how simple it is.
It was cold.
Have you heard from him often?
Your watch is slow.
You are on a ship?
This is simple.
How do you feel?
And how did he make his money?
Then what would happen?
Take good care of the little girl.
You know me well enough.
Never heard of it before.
Answer me this one question.
You may leave the room.
You are right, my love.
They had much to talk about.
That must be true.
Now, listen.
Has she any family?
Made me feel so young.
We must make the best of it.
They had heard all that before.
But what did we ever get for it?
Every word you said was heard.
Does she go fast?
Do you love her much?
Are you still cold?
In an hour?
Do you own a dog?
We serve them.
Had they been heard?
How soon will he be here?
Young man, you will go far.
No more money?
Where did they get the money from?
And what does she want the money for?
It can never happen.
In an hour it will be at the door.
It has been there ever since.
That is very simple.
That is true.
We will talk about that.
Where are you off to so early?
It is a fire.
From then on it was war between them.
What have you against me now?
It would be better if you went to the war.
Take notice.
He put his hand over part of the map.
We are ready.
The world is big enough.
Let us talk a little about my father.
So do you, my love.
Which king?
The dog is always with him.
Is the wind north or south?
You will soon know.
Is that true?
This was true.
They left in the morning.
Her only thought was to reach his side.
It will interest you, said he.
You had better go.
There are four hundred?
And you will always love him?
Better late than never.
You are better than that.
He said, get him out of the road.
As soon as you left, it began.
Why do we love?
So we came down this road.
Did you tell him your whole story?
Feel better then.
Let us leave them, she said.
They had said little, though they had been there a long time.
That may be true.
Did you get any money?
Who told you that?
We dont know enough.
But he never heard me.
But enough of this.
Was there ever such a boy as this?
Look at the paper you hold in your hand.
It would have been more simple.
A better man than you.
Half a mile?
Now listen to me.
To know her is to love her.
Was he young or old?
Dont answer like that, my good girl.
Look to the west.
You remember the place, my father?
She was only a little girl.
And so they began to talk.
That was the rule, she said.
He had my love.
How does this happen?
Ten, did you say?
This will pass in no time.
Well, said the girl, let us go.
We got her half way.
Remember that time?
What kind of a bird?
In short, take me.
He is very simple.
Ask them to sing one more song.
Let us talk about you.
Do you remember him?
He got it this morning.
The rock was very small.
He had enough of it.
There was no time to think of what might happen.
Let me also ask you a question.
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.
Better write it here.
We were up early.
This money was for her.
What will happen to us?
Keep in step.
Five young children.
She is fast?
So the question was, what to do?
That is enough.
Long and the short of it.
How could that happen?
But why must you leave me so soon?
It was a round table.
This is my body.
Let that pass.
Let this man pass.
How many children did he leave?
You are right, young man.
What size do you want?
Light my fire.
Against what side?
You have an hour.
You had better come to my house, said the man.
It is the rule.
