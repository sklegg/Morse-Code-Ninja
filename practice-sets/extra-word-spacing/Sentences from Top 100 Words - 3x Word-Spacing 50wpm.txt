What is he like?
Look at him.
Who is she?
How did he do it?
Did you know them?
What is it like?
That will do, he said.
How can it be?
And what do you call her?
What will you do, then?
Who are you?
You can have some.
Is that it?
but there was more to it than this.
But what have they been up to?
That is what she did.
How is she?
But how about you?
You can do it.
who, then, are you?
and so on, and so on.
You know more than we do.
And what do you make of it?
What did he do to you?
What DO you know of him?
What was he like?
Do they know him?
Then who are you?
How can you know?
But what are you up to?
Look at it.
And who is this?
No was there one?
How was that?
When is it?
Come this way.
Do you see him?
How did you know about it?
We have him.
Who and what are you?
The time had come.
But what will you do?
And what was it for?
Now you know.
At what time?
Look over it.
What is that?
Do you like him?
When was that?
And is that all?
Did you see it?
When was it?
And who was that?
May we come in?
But it has been so long.
Then how many are there?
Who was he?
And all for what?
What have you come for?
No one will come, she said.
What was it about?
How would you like to have it?
So there it was.
You may go.
That will do, said he.
That is a long time.
Had to look the other way.
are you there?
What did you do then?
Did you know him?
Has it come to this?
Will that do?
How is he now?
What was it?
And what did you do then?
What are we to do?
But will he see it?
And could she see him?
What do they call you?
How did she do it?
What do you see?
But he had no time.
But he had to have it.
One or two?
Out of the way.
Is it like him?
what is it?
But who was she?
There is but one thing to do.
Do you know her?
And who are you?
So that was the way.
You have it.
He said no.
How long has he been there?
There he is, you see.
But so it is.
How do you do?
What is it for?
Do you know what you look like?
Will you come and see her?
That was it.
Is that all?
Then there is more to do.
So it is.
Did you see her?
Do as you will.
That was all she said.
Can it be?
And what is that?
What is it about?
Is he there?
Can you do that?
Or so they said.
But how is that?
What is there to see?
You can go.
Do you see it?
How did you come by it?
And what did you see?
What do you make of that?
Who will go first?
Can one see from there?
Then what are you up to now?
The time will come.
And how did you find out?
There you are, he said.
You have them?
Do as you like.
What can we do, then?
Is she like him?
Which is it?
And has it come to this?
But it was of no use.
Do you know?
But what is it?
What do you make of it?
At what number?
There he is, do you see him?
Would you do what he did?
But WHAT DID you see?
Now there is no more to be said.
What is it all about?
Are you there?
Now is your time.
How are you?
What would she have said?
Who was that?
Then, how do you know?
There you are.
What are you up to?
but what if it is?
What time is it?
Then what is it?
Did you know her?
We have no water.
There were two of them.
Call him in.
And do you like him?
Now what are we to do with you?
And do you like her?
But when will that be?
Look at it this way.
It was from you.
They said no more.
You know how it is with her.
Do you know what it is?
There they are.
And when will you call?
What other way is there to look at it?
Is it time?
Is that her?
Do you know him?
who can it be?
Tqhen you may go.
Then make it up.
She has it.
What is all this?
So be it.
Go on, he said.
So it was.
Is it over?
what has she to do with it?
but we can go and see.
Look at them.
What could it be?
Would you like some?
There he is, she said.
What did they do?
What can this be?
How is he?
Who and what are you?
Do they know him?
And what was it for?
So that was the way.
Look at him.
And when will you call?
That is what she did.
That will do, said he.
who, then, are you?
But what are you up to?
When is it?
What is it like?
How do you do?
But so it is.
What did you do then?
Then who are you?
But who was she?
The time will come.
And how did you find out?
How would you like to have it?
At what time?
There were two of them.
And who are you?
The time had come.
How are you?
Now is your time.
Is that it?
Call him in.
How can it be?
What time is it?
But will he see it?
That is a long time.
Go on, he said.
And who was that?
How is he?
And is that all?
And do you like him?
Do as you will.
Look at it this way.
What can we do, then?
What is all this?
but what if it is?
But how about you?
Would you do what he did?
We have no water.
Do you know what you look like?
What was it about?
There you are, he said.
When was it?
Can you do that?
That will do, he said.
Who will go first?
and so on, and so on.
What is that?
Do you know him?
What will you do, then?
What do you make of that?
What do they call you?
What is he like?
How can you know?
Would you like some?
There you are.
You can go.
Then there is more to do.
One or two?
Come this way.
Are you there?
There is but one thing to do.
Then what are you up to now?
No one will come, she said.
Has it come to this?
Tqhen you may go.
but we can go and see.
But what will you do?
Then what is it?
How was that?
How long has he been there?
That was all she said.
And what is that?
Did you know her?
But it has been so long.
But he had to have it.
Or so they said.
Do you see him?
Is it over?
Is he there?
what has she to do with it?
And who is this?
Who was he?
What did they do?
What other way is there to look at it?
Do you see it?
Is it time?
What would she have said?
Now there is no more to be said.
But how is that?
Is that all?
How did you come by it?
Is she like him?
What have you come for?
Did you see her?
And what did you do then?
Then how many are there?
Out of the way.
who can it be?
Then, how do you know?
And what do you call her?
What are we to do?
are you there?
No was there one?
What are you up to?
What could it be?
Will that do?
How did you know about it?
So it is.
There he is, you see.
There he is, do you see him?
What is it all about?
What was he like?
What did he do to you?
What is it for?
You know how it is with her.
But what is it?
But when will that be?
Do as you like.
Look over it.
May we come in?
What is there to see?
Who is she?
There he is, she said.
Who was that?
She has it.
You know more than we do.
Look at it.
but there was more to it than this.
How did she do it?
Can one see from there?
Is that her?
And what did you see?
How is she?
What do you see?
You can do it.
Who are you?
And what do you make of it?
Then make it up.
Did you know them?
How is he now?
There they are.
So be it.
What can this be?
When was that?
Do you know her?
At what number?
Look at them.
What is it about?
And could she see him?
You have them?
Did you see it?
Now you know.
Will you come and see her?
It was from you.
So it was.
But he had no time.
Which is it?
what is it?
Now what are we to do with you?
What was it?
And do you like her?
But WHAT DID you see?
But it was of no use.
But what have they been up to?
So there it was.
Do you like him?
What do you make of it?
That was it.
Is it like him?
Can it be?
We have him.
Did you know him?
How did he do it?
You may go.
You can have some.
You have it.
Had to look the other way.
Do you know what it is?
And all for what?
What DO you know of him?
He said no.
Do you know?
And has it come to this?
They said no more.
