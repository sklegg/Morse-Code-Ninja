What did the letter contain?
Decide if you are going back home.
The night is so long, and yet so short.
But it must be done soon.
She got up, and ran out of the room.
Perhaps he did.
There is your old bed.
Yes, my love?
You can hear that, miss?
Yes, she was back.
Never mind that.
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?
It was cold and dark.
You brought no one with you?
Is it possible?
He began to laugh.
No, nothing of the kind.
Laugh, if you will.
And he told you nothing?
At his side was a large green box.
My mind is made up.
Well then, be quick.
In a minute.
Answer me that, miss.
His will be done.
Dont laugh.
Wonder is it like that.
And what a voice she has.
Oh, do you know?
What age is he?
They need a rest.
Half the town was there.
They would cry.
It has to be done.
Never mind me.
What can be done?
It was hot.
Why did you bring him here?
Oh, if men only knew.
Be quick, for the time is short.
Do you see that island?
Come, let me show you my plan.
Did he fall?
But never mind that.
Yes, that was a picture book.
You must have a rest.
He has a good voice still.
Oh, no.
Did it all rest on me?
Each of us had done his work as well as he could.
It must be done at once.
Yes, but what did she say?
Wait a second.
Fly, my friend.
Oh, tell me.
It was a dark night.
You must stay.
You are in my power.
Go and rest.
Nothing could have been better.
What have they done with my work?
It might have done me good.
But what then must be done?
I hear his voice in the house.
Leave the rest to me.
It was so very long ago.
There, by the wheel.
That would be a fine thing.
Of course it might.
She got her hand free.
You could see there was a story behind it.
Is that a fact?
That was well done.
What is power?
It was full of people.
Is that possible?
She brought it home in less than an hour.
And here is the note.
He is among us.
If you fall dont wait to get up.
Here is our plan.
You heard me say why, a minute ago.
Where can you wait for me?
Will you rest here a little?
Bring them here.
Then bring them to me, she said.
Nothing at all.
Wait for me here, all of you.
Money is no object?
He ran up to them.
He left long ago.
And what have you done to me?
It is nothing.
Sit down, said the old man.
Wait and see.
That is possible.
He stood up.
Wait a minute.
Yes and no.
Lead me to him.
She gave me her hand.
Nothing is more simple.
Of course they will.
It was very dark.
How is that done?
This made him wonder more and more.
Well, sit down by me.
It is a real bed.
Oh, come now.
The whole day had been hot.
Nothing had come of it.
Good to rest once in a way.
Yes, he said.
Again came the voice.
It was a long time before she could sleep.
Yes, sit down.
Quick, you must make it to me at once.
Of course he was right.
Is it certain?
But wait a minute.
Oh, nothing.
Yes, she could sing that.
Oh, this is too much.
Oh, man.
Yes, that is what will happen to you.
Perhaps you will go and live with him too?
What has he done?
All of this was possible.
Yes, to be sure.
Perhaps you would like to read it.
Try to sleep.
How long would you keep me in town?
He is in the box.
It is no use, said a voice.
Oh, do the best you can.
But what must be done?
Your voice is that of a young man.
See what you have done.
We are free to act and think.
What is done is done.
Oh, how can you sleep?
He must be in the same boat as us.
Nothing could be more simple.
But they could see nothing.
Better sit still.
The old man gave no answer.
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.
Oh, of course.
In that town there is a street.
She began to cry.
It was right in front of us.
The night was very dark.
Oh, just listen.
She could think of nothing more to say.
You will fall.
Now we must wait.
Well, there he stood.
Come back to us as soon as possible.
It was a warm night.
He was here a minute ago.
Never mind how he came here.
Look at that dark water.
Is my father in town?
He brought it with him for us to see.
Be back in a minute.
Well, of course.
You know nothing about it.
What more is to be done?
Yes, but only for you and me.
Why should my father fly?
But let us see your plan.
Let me see your plan.
She heard and saw nothing.
She was still game.
And sit in the dark?
It is very clear.
My mind was soon made up.
In her name, then, let it be done.
Oh, do as you like.
The island was a mile long.
You love a certain person.
Yes, once.
Which box do you mean?
Oh, to be sure.
Yes, she said.
It must be done.
What has brought you here?
Yes, what is it?
Oh, all right.
Go back to bed.
That is a fact.
It is done.
It is time for bed.
How can a little dog laugh?
Hold on a minute.
Very well, wait a minute.
Have you told them to bring the horse?
Yes, it did.
You knew it, and said nothing?
There is no possible way.
Oh, you are there.
Quick, friend, quick.
No, nothing at all.
It is all done.
The snow is deep.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Clear my name.
How was it done?
Help me sit up.
All right then, sit down.
It was done.
Oh, take those off.
A fine thing too.
Oh, go on.
Well, perhaps it was best for him.
We must be quick.
Did she stay long?
He never said nothing.
There is nothing more to be said.
Clear the way.
Well yes, you are right.
And you can do nothing until then?
It was so long ago.
What brought you here?
Yes, said the old man.
Why, of course.
We brought them in.
Get to bed.
Then it is certain?
What a game.
Oh, that is very simple.
Sit down, he said.
Yes, it is true.
Can it be possible?
He had, to be sure, done much.
Yes, we know that.
Who gave it to you?
Well, miss?
Of course she will.
Oh, but you were there?
What have they done?
Yes, tell them to bring me my horse.
It stood behind the door.
Let us sit down.
But she is nothing to me now.
Yes, go and find out.
He ran when he saw his father on the ground.
It must be a new moon out, she said.
Yes, that is true.
Who brought you up?
It is his voice.
Well, sit down.
Is he in bed?
is it come yet?
Her voice was low.
Go when you are ready, and sleep well.
He had made up his mind.
Stay where you are.
His plan is very simple.
Just let us go free.
Oh, dont ask me.
Do you have my note?
We know from the record that he was on the water.
There was more to be done.
It was a record run.
Oh, he is so kind.
Come, and we can rest together.
He saw nothing.
When we got home the house was all dark and still.
The night was dark.
And yet you are the better off?
The water ran dry.
Yes, all right.
Come quick.
Yes, you are right.
He gave me this paper.
Why does the boat go so fast?
Wonder what he does.
You must stay with me.
Of course it is.
Are they on foot?
Then lead the way.
You know you must say yes.
Yes, and no.
And then the game began all over again.
They know nothing about it.
It was brought to me.
This is a test.
People might know my voice and find me out.
Keep clear of him.
Go in there and drive them out.
He must cover a lot of ground in one day.
It was a cold, dark night.
He knew nothing.
It is possible.
There is a lot of people.
The city was soon behind me.
He must wait.
Then all was dark again.
Bring it here.
Oh, said he, that is life to me.
You can sleep here.
Nothing new under the sun.
Oh, very well, he said.
Perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
How long ago?
Then he must be a wonder.
His first cry was for his father.
Are you strong?
Yes, go on.
Oh, is he on land or sea?
Oh let me in.
The little boy lay in his bed.
and so he decide he go back home.
There is no one in that room behind you.
Just go to sleep.
Yes, very well.
The whole night the tree stood still.
How was that possible?
They all fall to the ground.
Clear the table.
But how long ago?
Move on, my men, as quick as you like.
But that is nothing to us.
We are more strong together.
What kind of voice is it?
They call him a fine boy.
Wait for me.
It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
Like these in shape and size?
It was a kind of language between us.
Play the game out.
Behind my bed.
It is certain.
Let him go free?
Did she fall?
Behind every book is a man.
Free to do what?
Nothing she can eat?
Teach me what to do and how to use it.
Yes, he did.
It was a very dark night.
If only it were possible for me to see her once more.
Yes, of course.
If only they would be quick.
All that for nothing?
You better stay here all night.
This voice was that of my father.
Fine, very fine.
And yet you said he had money.
Bring this with you.
Well, what does that lead up to?
Take good note of it.
Let her wait.
He will sleep an hour.
Money is power.
What have you done?
Yes, there it is.
All was dark.
Oh, take me with you.
Wonder if he has a name.
Sit down and let us talk it over.
Well, but where can he fly to?
Yes, he said, all of it.
You are free to do so.
Oh, that.
Well, what about my plan?
